Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,The stool looks good and is sturdy but the cushion is super thin.  Sitting on the stool becomes a bit uncomfortable after a while.  The company should definitely add more cushion to the stool.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,The smokes don't fit in the grooves.  It's as if the plastic cooled to much and shrunk when manufacturing.  Had to smash the ciggs to get them to fit instead of them going in effortlessly.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great product. It's tall enough so utensils don't fall out, Short enough so you can take utensils out if you keep it on the counter with cabinets above and wide enough to hold quite a few utensils."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,i love the con-tact brand lite tack light adhesive shelf liner. easy to install and easy to remove with no residue.  The regular contact is difficult to remove and leaves an adhesive mark on the shelf.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"A great size and shape and it is nice to have the tray option.  The yellow is lighter than expected, more of a lemon color, but a nice bright pop of color in the dark basement."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I do a lot of cooking and baking and find that these small bowls help me prep my dishes. I particularly like having the different colours to help remind me of what ingredients are in which bowl.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Totally disappointed in this product. Haven't had a good batch of ice cream yet.  The outside freezes but the inside stay soft. And then when you put it into the freezer it turns into ice crystals

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week before the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I didn't even know I needed this bottle opener, and now I'm obsessed. Always conveniently located right on the fridge, but small enough that it's not tacky. Our friends always comment on how handy it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Solid build quality, works very well for cooking things like spaghetti. I also use it for random noodle dishes and so on. The locking lid works very well, fits securely and makes draining very easy and effortless."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Nice and sturdy, and the size and shape comes in handy when a 1-cup is too small.  Easy to read markings.  Haven't used the strainer yet, but it may come in handy down the road."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great heater for bedrooms or other small to medium rooms.  Shuts off when it reaches the desired temp.  The listed temp may not be exact, but you can adjust to your comfort."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Please note that this is for the single large 3d skull, not the smaller multiple 3d skull mounds. I use this huge one to make sugar skulls, it is sturdy and great for chocolate and sugar sculpture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I thought this would be a perfect keep at work filtered water solution yet the space the filter takes up makes this somewhat clunky tumbler's capacity limited to 26 oz and as such need of frequent refilling.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very fl"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Love how it is self explanatory. The only problem is that it doesnt turn on the oven. It is so small that it will be impossible to get the oven to turn on it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Flimsy, JUNK, hardly a  Panacea, Not nearly worth the money.
Has the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen,  omitting information as how to sequence the pieces
so as not to require disassemble to position the parts properly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The serving closure on the top will not lock you will have to tape it down if you carry it, and that's  why I brought this item! I learned this the hard way. Brought two of these:-("

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Cannot withstand daily use, even with an electric stove. I will not recommend this product to anyone. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This was shipped with an adhesive backing and the finish is very smooth.  The dimensions are just right.  The finish is nice and solid and is a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I use these in my kitchen. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they do not have the dishwasher feature.  The dishwasher is a great feature and I don
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Super sturdy and heavy, the exact dimensions I needed for a bedside table. The 3 drawers open and close effortlessly and hold a considerable amount. The pull out tray slides easily and is perfect for holding the occasional drink."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These are cute & all of mine had good seals.  The only issue I had was all the stickers on the bottom of them when I received them.  Pain to remove those, but I got it done."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This Cookware Set Has Performed Great so Far I've Only Had It for about 2 Weeks But Whatever I Have Cooked Has Slid Right out Of on Cleaning The Only Bad Part Is That These Are Not Dishwasher Safe.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I didn't buy them for the quality. I bought them because my granddaughter wanted to tie dye a set of sheets. I usually like a much higher thread count, but these were great for what I had in mind"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Doesn't take up much room in the drawer and it's easy to take apart to clean. It's got a good edge on it and feels nice in my hand.

Edit: One year later this little wheel is still going strong."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I love this roaster. I use it for everything from roasts to slow cooker. I would have given it 5 stars except after a year the enamel insert got a chip and so far I cannot find a replacement.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Nice glass cup!!! This cup would go well with my new kitchen, and new table~and I like tea in the glass cup because I can see the kind of landscape, goods to the Cup outside the kind of mood."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Notice the wood handle is previously fitted then separated from its own utensil. Align each handle back into its own utensil and pound it in to wedge it. Season the handle several times with wood or mineral oil. Perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,What a gorgeous cup in such a gorgeous box. I'm beginning to collect mismatched teacups and this is my newest and favorite. What amazing quality and so pretty. Arrived perfectly safe in Amazon shipping. Very happy with my choice.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These dough rolling guides are AWESOME. It's great that the set had three sizes. I needed a much thinner dough than I anticipated, so I just used the next size down and rolled again.  They worked great.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Terrific bargain. Exactly the right color shown in pic. The hardest part was removing it from the box. I was able to attach the legs and set it up fairly easy. Sturdy product. Works well on our office/entertainment/spare room.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Although this opener does not separate the top from the sides, it seems to cut quite well without shards of metal in the can. Sometimes it has trouble grabbing the can and it has refused to open a few."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I just  purchased my second Black and Decker iron.  The first one performed well for a couple of hard-working years and I didn't hesitate to purchase the same model again. A good buy and a great iron.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I got these to hang in one of the bathrooms with the litter box to get rid of the litter box odor. Hung both of them in the bathroom but did not get rid of the litter box odor.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Nice material, but isn't all that practical to me. I reverted back to squashing garlic with my knife to peel and manually chopping it. Other times I just use my food processor for bulk garlic and mason jar storage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It works great and was extremely cheap. It is just the size that I wanted and got here quickly.  Great for corn or any kind of muffin.  Also good for cupcakes.  My daughter likes it too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and works perfectly plus you get the plastic lids.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These were just as described. This is my second set of these. Love using glass as storage as I am working to remove plastic from touching our food. They work well in dishwasher. Great product! Love the sizes too.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"For a memory foam/cooling gel pillow less than $100, this one is a quality product. Product is exactly as described, very soft, and keeps very cool. I wish it was not quite so soft, and was a bit firmer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,It was not put together already so we spent a long time attempting to create each tassel which was an extremely tedious process. I do not recommended this product unless you have time to put it together before hand.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Snuggly and good looking however, it is a very thin piece of plastic that is hard to remove.

I had to replace it with a different one because the cover is very fragile."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,I bought this for my daughter who is an avid runner. She loves it!  She has a pair of running shoes and a pair of shoes that fit perfectly in it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Looks great in my living room. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best vacuum bags I have ever owned. This vacuum is very powerful and it's"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This salt mill is easy to set up and very comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very fragile.

"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I am very pleased with this set and the quality. I will keep my review for future reference.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I love the concept.  We have two dogs and they are all very happy with the product.  We are not using the plastic ones.  The plastic ones are a great size and are easy
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"The handle is way too small for the wide handle. I will keep my thumb in the center.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall person. She has a lot of"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,The pepper prepper works great.  I love the taste.  My husband likes it too.  It is so easy to use.  Easy to clean.  I'm a very large fan
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Excellent cooking press.  I've had it for a year and I still love it.  I just wish it had a little more plastic, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,Nice-looking and very easy to use. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to slide the bottom so it's a bit of a pain to get out of the way.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Would have given this five stars. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this to bring some rice to a"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"We use these spatulas for a number of reasons, and I will list my favorite ones below.

1.  The spatulas are very sharp, and the first time I used them,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These are wonderful and are perfect for the summer. I will keep them for the winter and they will be perfect for the summer. I have the Tumbler and it works great.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I guess long term quality control will be an issue. I will keep my expectations in mind. Great product. Great price. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"After using these for a few weeks, the only thing I did not like is the way the blades slide down. The plastic part is also very stiff and not flexible at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Very soft sheets in lovely colors. The only problem is that it's not really comfortable to sleep on. If you want to get up and down, the pillow is a great choice."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have a couple of small containers and they are just too large.  They are easier to empty and move around.  I am using this for the first time in a trash can because it is
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I wouldn't say this product is an improvement on the previous model, but for the price, it's a great buy. The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"purchased in April, they are perfect. The only problem is that they are not really the same color.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!  It's great for storing"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Bought this for my daughter's room.  She loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am using it for the first time in a very large room
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Quick shipping!

Minus 1 because it doesn't blend ice like a Ninja, but it is awesome none the less.  Once you master your favorite drink or smoothie you will truly appreciate its stainless steel construction. Keeps it chill, real chill."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"The quality was so bad it was laughable. The plastic is so flimsy that it won't latch shut without a  gap. Not exactly going to seal in the freshness. Also, the plastic ""hinges"" look really fragile. I'm returning it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas since he said he needed a pan big enough to cook fish in.  We use it frequently for swai, and it comes pre-seasoned, which is nice as well!  A great product!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Two of the pans worked fine. The 8"" pan didn't. I had to put a 6""x6""by 1/8"" steel plate under it to get it to work. The non-stick coating works as expected. For the price it is what it is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I'd give it 5 stars, but it doesn't come with a 1/2 Tablespoon measure, which would be very helpful.  Since there's 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon, you have to use 2 different spoons to get a 1/2 Tbsp measure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Usable but not as good as a namebrand one I've use.  The vacuum seal part is a little silly with having to turn clockwise and counter clockwise.  But ok - you pay for what you get is true.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,While some people feel its necessary to write a novel I will keep this short and sweet.  This is a very good turkey injector. Well made and an extremely good value. It does exactly what I purchased it for
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Works great! Once we changed out the filter the hand vac works so much better. I didn't want to purchase a whole
New vac and thanks to this I didn't have to. You will definitely notice a big difference in performance!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Does what it says.  Seems well made and durable  Not some cheap, flimsy piece of plastic crap from China, though it may be from China, who knows.  Bottom line is its well made, you can just tell."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I drink a lot of cocktails and like to have the drink chilled. If you freeze the glass it has a large glass base that helps with keeping the cocktail chilled. The price is a bit high but it works.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"It's alright.  The hair catcher doesn't stay put when washing hair in the sink, but this is just my situation.  This may work well for others.  The item is well made, with small ""teeth"" to catch hairs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I gave this as a gift to someone who likes turtles and LOVES cooking. She tells me they are perfect and really cute. So that works for me too! Actually they look even better in person than in the picture.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Perfect size for my 2 year old to drink fresh smoothies & juices. Quality stuff - made in Italy,  lead-free and plastic-free. The lids are starting to rust after a year, but maybe the rust could be cleaned off."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are really good trouser hangers.  And, the price was good for the 4-pack.  Definitely would get more
if needed.  I hang the pants at the bottom of the leg section and they hold them nicely and wrinkle-free."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We just redid our closets, so I wanted to be 'SUPER"" organized. And these ""Dream Drawer Organizer"" fit the bill. Easy to use/install since they're spring-loaded. Just make sure you are aware of the ""length"" and ""height"" that you need."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Sturdy hammer, great price. Projections of tenderizing face are rather shallow; may not penetrate meat enough to do the job. Handle is not as comfortable as I had hoped. I may wish to exchange the item for a different design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I am very disappointed with this product.  The cheese slicer broke at the base of the handle in less than 6 months.  i used this product to  slice colby cheese  five to six times a week.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I absolutely love this Dutch Oven!  Already made several dishes using it.  A friend of mine had it and loved it, so I got one for myself.  Highly recommended if you love cooking stews, sauce, chili, etc."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Arrived fast and fits great. Thick tablecloth and washes well, i even throw in dryer and no need to iron. A cup of water was spilled on top of tablecloth and it did it soak through to my wood table!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Great simple desk! Super easy to assemble. Packaged really well, arrive way quicker than expected (two days, max).
I took away one star because you don't get to use all of the drawer, it doesn't pull out all of the way."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This was very easy to put together and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the holes are very large."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"The pitcher started leaking after a couple of weeks, which is a nice bonus. I'm not sure how well it will hold up, but it is still a nice pitcher. I would definitely recommend it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Bought this pattern for my daughter's wedding. It is a little more expensive than the other one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Received early ahead of schedule, and it arrived with a very good seal.  The dimensions were exactly what I was looking for.  The attachments are very easy to use.  I would definitely recommend"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Have used this type of vacuum for the last 10 years. I have a small vacuum and this is a great one. The attachments are small, but the vacuum is very reliable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Perfect for their intended purpose: keeping an open space on a shelf.  This is a great product.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I am having fun exploring this set and am very pleased with it. The colors are just as shown and the packaging is very nice. The ring is a nice addition to any decor.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This Stainless Steel Spoon Rest (Cordless)

Weighs just under 1/4 pound and we love it. The attachments are very easy to use and it is easy to clean."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Works perfectly with my FoodSaver. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of burlap sacks, which is what the plastic bags are made of."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"While it will hold your coffee, you can't beat the price.

The only downside is that it's very small. The bottom shelf is a little tight so it won't slide down.
"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great price. So easy to use. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very skinny and"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These are really wonderful.  They have the design and feel of a real cupcake.  They are a great size and the design is solid and clear.  I'm sure I will be buying more
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"This is not tall enough for me, but it is good enough for my 2 year old and we have two small dogs. I am considering getting another for her, so it is not that big of a"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These are just as described. They are lightweight and comfortable. I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice, but not a big deal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Everyone said this was a nice set, but the instructions are a little difficult to read.  The instructions are not very clear.  There is no way to figure out what is going on with the blades"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Love it, we have a small house and the stove is too hot. This is a great one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I purchased this to replace a destroyed part of the stove I had.  It's been one of my favorite things to use.  I also bought the Tumbler to get it to go over my
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,This item is a total waste of money.  Not worth it.  I would order from another manufacturer.I had a similar model before and used the Tumbler for years. It worked well and
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"The image on the hallmark of this item is very close to the original, but the design has been removed so that the box is not visible. The box itself is a great size and is very well made"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a very low napped rug. I thought it was gray and white but it looks more like gray and cream. I have it in a high traffic area and its easy to keep clean. Im very happy with this.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Awful soap dispenser. I would give it no stars if I could. The bottom is screwed on. Plus it leaked from both the bottom and the top where the seam is. I had to throw it away. Complete waste of money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Was so disappointed this is so small not worth the money then there was a metal rod in the box I guess to add weight. I will not buy from this seller again it was an embarrassing gift for my daughter
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We bought this board for pre-photo prep for a collection of 4-6"" dolls. This board is useful for a tabletop, counter, or other work surface. Well padded and narrow end allows us to get to tiny costume areas."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is cute, the sugar packets are much thinner than this is so I just loaded it up with tea bags and set it next to my kureg. The color is solid black and it has a good weight to it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It's still in the box because I am saving it for a special time to give to my husband. He loves smiley faces so will probably give it to him for Valentines. I really like it so I know he will!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Baked items release so easily from this pan.  Ordered two.  Clean up was a breeze.  Cannot ask for more.  Now even my packaged cakes rise higher since using 8 inch pan instead of 9 or 10 inch.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love this thing! Not owning a microwave means I needed an easy way to heat milk that's easy to pour without a mess (unlike a saucepan, I'm clumsy). Along with my Aeropress and my frothing wand, it's cappuccinos every morning!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a heavy duty, clear shower curtain liner, which I like very much.  One can see through it as clear as looking through a window, and its heavy duty construction ensures that it will last for years and years."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Bought this bag to take on our two week cruise. Seems to be well made and sturdy and I can just throw it in the bottom of the suitcase and it's there to do self service laundry while on the ship.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,We looked everywhere in stores for a product like this with no luck.  Thankfully we found it online. It is precisely what we needed to give some more hanging space in the closet. The product is durable and priced reasonably.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Amazing frame! I purchased a 20x30 frame and was worried about what I would get, but it is solidly built and beautiful.  And it came with the proper hardware to hang it, not just a tiny sawtooth piece of junk."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The quality for the metal branches is not that great, the edges are sharp too. They are mediocre, got them for my formal dining room, but will use them for casual dining instead. The pics look better than the actual product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Good sturdy rug suitable for use in a beach house or where there is heavy traffic & dirt. It has a natural rustic appeal & can be cleaned by being shaken out. It works very well in my heavily used hallway.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I'll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,It doesn't stay in place well. After a number of hot water experiences it still does not lie flat. The suction cups don't work well in our jacuzzi because the floor is not smooth. It is still nice to lay on.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love it.  It's sturdy and spins well despite a lot of weight on it.  I placed several large glass jars containing dry goods and it makes it a snap to get what I want in my deep kitchen cabinet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fantastic product.  A lot of complaints about wrinkles, but I have never opened a fabric item package and have it come out looking ironed.  You will have to iron creases.  Very good quality.  I would buy again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,These pillow covers are very durable! The only complaint is that the pillow on the right is much more faded than the pillow on the left. I would much rather they were both the same- either both faded or both bold.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"We bought this years ago and it is still going strong.  I love it!Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, and she is very pleased with the quality.  The color is beautiful and"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"The sham fit perfectly. It looks great and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love the fact that it has a wide opening. I also love that it's removable. It is so easy to clean. The attachments are small, but the holes are very large. I have had no"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Bought two; on one of them I had an inch in the middle and one in the middle of the bottom. I've had a couple of these, and they are great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Holy s***, these sheets. I can't go back to the old days of cold sheets that were too warm and we had to have the extra sheets, but they're okay."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Absolutely great items to use, especially for the price.Very good quality.Nice, sturdy, and functional.  Great for the price.  Not too big or too small.  The only thing I would"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Unfortunately, somehow it did not go into the freezer and it was cold.

The only way to get a good slice of the meat is to get the meat out first.  This is a bit difficult"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,Just OK. Does its job. I love the look and feel of this pillow. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The pillow is a nice white color and is comfortable.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Excellent quality, and Amazon had a good deal on the item. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Light weight, cooking pot good for an entire day, and I will keep my lid on this one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These pillow cases were purchased for a friend and she loved them. These were the first one she bought so we had to get a second one for her. She is very pleased with them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"South Shore furniture look good and have the quality to them.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the bed is a bit small, but it does take up most of the room. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Great gift idea for a kid. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides.I have had this product for
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Excellent wire mesh strainer on the back and the cord is included in the package. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The cord is not flexible at all and does not stay in
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Very easy to put together and assemble, the only thing I did not like is the hinge and the bottom plate. The plastic parts are also very cheap plastic, so it is not worth it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I would have given 5 stars if the design was a little better.

The only downside is that the top is a bit of a mess, but if you don't care about that, it is okay"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have purchased several projection spoons and they work just fine.  These have a strong edge to them and have a nice weight to them.  The plastic is a great material and the color is beautiful.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"The entire set up is a mess, the only part I really love is the yellow button that is on the top. The plastic part is also very light and not sturdy. I would definitely buy again. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This arrived a week earlier than I expected. YAY!!! It's wonderful. It felt like a waterbed the first time I sat  --or rather ""sank"" into it. But after a while everything worked out. It feels like a soft-medium mattress. Just wonderful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Just received it last night. Took it out of the packaging and there are some stains on it. Not sure from what. It's for my daughter and she will try it in a week and I'll be able to comment on comfort.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"You have to have some dainty little teacups for these things to hold more than 2. The quality is very poor; each hook is a slightly different shape and size than the others. Very unstable on the shelf, too. Waste of money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Recently bought this knife because its size and shape are comfortable to do many things. The quality is very nice as well. Knowing up front, it was not made in Germany, I am happy with its cost and value. Made in Thailand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I like it but it's too big for most garbage bags. I have to use an oversized bag for a liner. As in other reviews, it came dented. How can the company keep shipping these without putting them in a decent box?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I've been using these cookie sheets for years. My originals are in great shape but I ordered a couple more for our vacation home. They arrived with a few dents but I don't think this will affect the function of the pans.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have been using a hand grinder for years, but it had a difficult time cutting through venison sinew.  Then I bought this ... cuts through all the cuts of meat with ease.  Wish I had bought one years ago."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I cannot say enough about this blender. This is my second one (just wanted the updated version due to the extra blade and the more sealed up top) and I use it nearly daily for protein shakes. Convenient, easy clean up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"They appear to be thicker than the other ones i have, they are built solidly, perhaps these are made out of just glass where as the others i have may be made out of crystal? in any case they do work well"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I wanted a silverware tray that was cheap in price, but good in quality.

I put this in my kitchen drawer backward, so the junk compartment is to the front, but the spoons, etc., are still in easy reach.

I'm glad I got it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"great clock. I have used it now for over 5 years without issue.  I use too have to get up every other day at different times, the reason I bought it.  great clock no issues for over 5 years now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These things are kind of cool but whatever dish you're trying to seal better be dry. They seal pretty well with glass or corelle dishes, not so great with anything metal. Again, make sure your container is dry for forget these things."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great little bookshelf. All of the holes lined up fine and there was no extra hardware! The rocket and all of the details are actually carved in and painted decently well. There are a few paint blemishes but overall really well done!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,works well - do not put near any heat it will warp the mat. accidently got too close to a pan and warped the edge. Most of it smoothed out but there are still some bumps. Still usable so all is good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,This is about half the size of what I expected. From top to bottom it will hang maybe half way down in your closet. To give you an idea of the size each pocket area holds about a half dozen sock pairs.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"It really is a beautiful cutting board and my wife could not be happier.  Seems like it's well made which makes me confident it will last for years to come.  A well crafted board at a competitive price; win, win."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,My mother in law loved this rug and she loves it too. This rug is a great value. I had to replace a couple of pieces that were not in great shape and that were broken.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Best colander ever.  I use it as a fruit and vegetable smoothie for my kids and they love it.  I've also used it to make the Tofu smoothie and it works great.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,These are a great addition to my kitchen.  I've also used them for the fruit and veg recipes.  The plastic ones are also very easy to clean.  I especially like that they are glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I got these for my daughter's wedding.  They are a nice size for the size of the wedding cake.  The cake is a bit small, but not too small.  The cake came well packaged and"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This is exactly what I wanted. The quality is just what I wanted. The dimensions are just what I wanted.  The bed is solid and is comfortable.  It is very large so it is a little smaller
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Made of heavy gauge sturdy wire, but feels really balanced when you are using it.  I bought this because I lost the one we had before.  I like this one so much better, I wish I'd lost the other one sooner."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"A great product for those of us who have chickens and don't want to keep using old egg cartons.  Super sturdy so it won't break any time soon and fits 18 eggs, more if you stack them when you're over run ;)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Purchased one of these just over a year ago. Was fine for that period of time and suddenly stopped cooling. Company is no help. Three calls, three referrals to service companies, two of which do not work on Avanti, one out of business."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Works like a charm. You can even put the lid back on the can if you need to. Freaking awesome. I might order more as gifts. If you know anyone that has problem working the manual openers, this would be a perfect gift."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love this little box, I keep my glasses in it at night.  I have another one with a different pattern that I use to keep my hearing aids in.  It looks better on the night stand than the original holders."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The price/quality ratio is pretty good, but as is, the desk sits too low to be used by an adult. However, if you spend about $8 on table leg extensions (and all day search for the size you need) it's a good product"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love this vacuum sealer!  So much more convenient than my other large vacuum!  I keep it on the cabinet and use it several times a day.  Not as fast as the big one but so much easier to use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These were exactly what I expected. They look great (clean). I use them to keep my flour/sugar/etc. on the counter for easy access. I haven't noticed any air leaking into the canisters either. They are very light, and they get the job done."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Just got my bread pans today and really like the way they are constructed.  Can't wait to make paleo bread in them because I can pull the sides of the pan out to see if the bread set up before baking it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Once you get used to the settings, it makes deliciously, moist meats!!
We seared our meat for just a couple minutes after cooking. It is a great kitchen addition and would highly recommend!
We put the seasoned meats in one sealed bag, veggies in another."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This product is perfect for dresses you don't use often.  For  me this means it's in the extra bedroom closet.  The frameless part is a bit odd but I know it won't break, and the plastic is extra heavy duty."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My wife and I have already made multiple batches of gummies with this product. I was afraid the dropper to fill them wasn't going to work, however I was very pleased. After letting them sit up they popped right out and were delicious!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great glasses; perfect size for lattes.  They keep the drinks really hot without burning your fingers.  I bought two and now I want to buy two more!  A little on the expensive side... but you get what you pay for.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Easy pan to flip Really great nonstick. I would have liked a few more recipes but it seems to be more intuitive than stick to a precise recipe. Just learn a method and change it up according to what you want to use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available for this size, I got what I paid for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"this is very different for us as we are used to the glass.  Our problem is that we've been through three glass ones and when I say the stainless, it seemed to be the answer.  We do miss the waterline though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I put this on a brick wall over my fireplace, next to a painting of a Autumnal forest that is mostly red. Looks great. The clock is silent, keeps perfect time and is easy to read. I really am glad I got it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"EDIT: The seal failed after a couple of years, which is a shame because it's been one of the worst experiences I've had with a vacuum. The plastic part inside is very fragile and it's difficult to clean"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Very clever system; the plastic spout is wide enough to fit a lot of cheese, and the lever is so small that it's difficult to lift the spout, so it's not a big deal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love these towels, very soft and easy to wash. I also love that they are removable and can be removed.  The only thing I wish is that you could use a towel brush that you already have in the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Again I like the fact that it is wide enough for two adults to fit comfortably in.  It is so small that it is not easy to get around if you are pulling it up.  It is hard to get

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"After receiving the cake tin, I was hoping it would be a nice piece of cake decorating. It's not. The cake itself is beautiful and the design is solid. I love that it came with a few loose"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"These things leak. They leak. They don't stay in place. I need a fix.

I read the reviews and I am not going to waste my money on a trash can that doesn't stay in place"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I was worried when I saw this, but it is a great product!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The plastic is sturdy and it is easy to clean."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Much better than the weak plastic containers I bought at Wal-Mart.

The only downside is that the top is a bit flexible.  The plastic top is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Very quiet when running on low settings, but it is very noisy when running on high settings.Great product. Great price! I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is very quiet."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I was really disappointed with this set, as it is a bit cheaper than the ones I ordered.

I had a similar set before and they were a bit more expensive, but that is not a complaint.
"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,Mom doesn't like this because it has the design flaw. I will admit that it's been a little difficult to get the dishwasher to open since the dishwasher is so small. But that's not a problem with

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought a protective glove for when I use this because it is really sharp (and scary).  It worked great for slicing the fresh ginger to make candied ginger.  Love the different thickness adjustments.  Small size to store in small kitchen.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,The topper fit perfectly and is very comfortable. This is used on a spare bed that had a regular foam topper which got too warm and was uncomfortable. The feather topper provides just enough warmth where I only need one blanket which is perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Choosing the three gallon size was wise, a five gallon bottle was awkward for us oldsters. It holds enough water and is easy to carry with the side handle when full. The bottles seem sturdy although only time will tell how they hold up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Order this along with my cotton candy machine and it taste great. Creates nice soft cotton candy in seconds using the Great northern cotton candy machine. Just doesnt seem to have as much of a strong flavor as the other type of flossugars do.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Funny gag apron and it turns the girls heads for sure, made a little cheaply and runs small, but it's worth it.  Can't complain, it's the only time I could get my wang touched by women without my wife getting upset!  lol"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I read other reviews but bought this anyway. And I am not sorry. I have a smaller tub/shower so the words can be a little hard to read, But everyone I showed it to had no problem reading it and knowing what it was."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought one of these at IKEA for my cube at work. It does an excellent job of reducing the light level and making it easier to read.

The only complaint is that it can be tricky to find the entrance to the pole sleeves."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I actually LOVED it when it worked. Unfortunately it quit after two months of occasional use. I didn't use it every day but probably 10 times in a two month period and then it just quit. It wouldn't do anything at all. Very disappointing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"These logs maybe last about an hour. As soon as you light them up they start breaking down and falling apart. I bought them from Home Depot for $20 which was a complete waste of money. Any other brand will be better, trust me!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"really good juicer. We have had to for over a month now and have no problems at all. It does extract a lot of the pulp, so if you don't like that, you might want a different option, but other than that, no complaint!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought one last year for like 5bucks, and somehow a seller is listing it for 99cents so I bought 4!

But then the price went back up, I hate to put shopping bag on the ground, even at home, or in my own car."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Loved the first one i had and now the 2nd one :)  Just wish there was an easier way to clean. No i will not get another removable plate design. Each one i had never heated evenly like this old school GF classic.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love these TV trays. They look nice and seem built well. I couldn't be happier. I did see other reviews with brown pictures. I did not experience this with mine. I think this was a good buy and I would buy it again.

Nice and soft. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best vacuum bags I have ever owned.  I was very pleased with this purchase. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"It hangs well over the sink. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the same plastic ones.  The plastic ones are a bit duller than the plastic ones, and the plastic"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Love it! The grey is a real contrast with the white.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very fragile.

The only reason I"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This strainer works well doing what it's intended to do which is to strain out what I don't want from a hot pot.  Looks good.  Just need a place to hang it to show it off rather than stowing away in a drawer.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Overall the pan is a great value.  I use it mostly for frying foods.  The only drawback is that the finish on the frying surface grew dull after the first use and no matter what I do it stays dull and marbled looking.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Seemed like a good value, but a couple of the packages had either old or defective batteries in them. Not sure I would order this brand again. In a home where there are three hearing aides, it's important to know the batteries on hand work."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Husband loves this Calendar Clock.  It's very illuminating and big clear letters of numbers.  Excellent product especially for someone who can't keep up  with what day it is, both day of the week and date and time.  High recommend this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I like that these don't burn really quickly and the price was decent for the quantity (and array of colors) that I received. My only complaint is that they're still a little large for my chime holders so I gotta twist them in a bit.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,This thermostat worked great at first but soon crapped out. This is the second digital thermometer that I have tried this grilling season with both failing. I have since ordered the old school analog thermometer. I have had these last for years. Live and learn.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Used these for donuts and other desserts in our wedding, and let our friends borrow them for their wedding too. Easy to assemble and to clean, and still looks pretty good even though it's just white plastic. Well-represented by the Amazon pictures."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Very impressed this seller ships to APO and without extra fees either! Thank you!!!  Came in a compact box with the mattress cover already on it. Didn't take long to take its shape. No nasty smell like our last topper. Very comfy. Highly recommend.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is the most handy item I have ever used in the shower. It is sturdy and holds all my bottles of shampoo and conditioner with ease. It is out of the way and looks like it was built into the shower. I love it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,I love this steamer and was ready to rate it 5 stars but it broke on me (last time I used it was a few months ago so I'm not sure what happened). I am disappointed that it didn't last me longer than 2 years.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I like the bed cover, however, it sheds lint like crazy. Ive washed it three times on delicate cycle and dried it on delicate cycle as instructed but it still has a bunch of lint all over the place. Im hoping it will stop soon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Wonderful spice rack, fits right against the wall on my counter or put on the wall.  I find it holds good sized spice jars easily and I'm going to get another so I can put my other spices out where they'll be within reach."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the peppercorns long before the pepper mill arrived."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We put this under a small table in our nook. It is a perfect size and will easily hide a small coffee drop until I have time to clean.

This wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but we get onstant compliments. It is perfect."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a great lingerie bag.  I got two so I could use them to wash corsets that I wear with a period attire outfit from the 1800's.  The corsets come out of the washer just fine and are as clean as everything else.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Smells good but no foam.  I put it in three different foaming dispensers and NO FOAM just gel oozing out.  Bummed me out but I can still wash my  hands with the gel.  Just wanted foam. Got the wrong thing I guess.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I love the frame, except I got the wrong size and it was too big and bulky to return for an exchange. Because of that I have been living with the wrong size frame for over a year. Saving up to get the right size frame!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I just love this table, so so so so easy to set up, no real tools required. Holds weight with ease I sit on this table constantly (110 lbs) and everyone rests their feet on the shelf, it flexes but hardly and so far no issues."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great size to take to the market; you can fill them up with a lot of produce without them becoming so heavy that the handles break. Great reusable option because they don't take up a ton of space as some other bags do.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought one of these because I was afraid the 18' kit would be just a bit short.  I was right.  With this plus the 18' kit, it's perfect.
As a side note, in case you're wondering, it screws onto the Rutland brush rods perfectly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The product is just as described and sturdily made, but if I wanted another one I'd definitely buy it at a store.  Amazon shipped this small package in a box that measured about 20x14x12.  I can't think of any reason to be so wasteful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This rug is GORGEOUS! I've had it for a few weeks but have yet to place it on my kitchen floor.  My kitchen colors are the same as the rug.  It's of good quality; no hidden odors and just nice to look at it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"They are great but I have some problems with them.  I have a very heavy head and they are flat as a pancakes, but Ill put up another review later.  To tell you what I think.  This is only a few weeks now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is very nice; beats the plastic ones sold in grocery stores by a mile.  Brush appears very sturdy; still don't know where to get replacement brush heads,, but wand is certainly worth keeping.  Product is Very happy with look and is well made."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I purchased this tablecloth to use on Easter.  I removed it from the packaging and washed it in cold water on the ""hand wash"" cycle and dryed it on low.  It came out completely unusable.  It was full of snags, runs and wrinkles."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are the best pans that I have EVER had in my life. I absolutely ""love"" them. I have never had anything stick to them and they are really made heavy. I would highly recommend buying them. Great product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a solid piece of gear. I ordered it after seeing one at a friends house. 5 years old, and the handle shows no wobble. No warping, despite repeated misuse (kids). Then there's the lifetime warrantee. All in all, a sweet deal, a lifetime purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this to brine pork loin for making Canadian bacon. A 2 - 3 pound roast fits nicely, plenty of room to insure the meat is submerged completely, the top fits tight enough that I can turn it upside down without it leaking (not recommended)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Likely these are priced to sell the non-metal finished version but these work for us.

The wife is a Diet Cola person , I am more of a root beer kinda guy. Having bottles with two different colors makes it easier to know which is for whom."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"These, even after washing are not an issue.  The two of us have a small baby one.  If we had to replace, I would get the one with a microfiber cloth.I had no idea that this was"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I used to use the old ones, but now they're all gone.  I'm just going to get a new one.

Update:  I bought this to replace my old one.  It's still working fine,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I like the material and the size, the finish is good, and the color is nice and vibrant. I had to replace a couple of pieces of plastic, so it is not that big of a deal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I wanted glass vs Teflon. I wanted a glass which was smooth and didn't have a tendency to slide down. The glass is solid and is light weight, so it is not too heavy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I absolutely love that the spout is wide and you can't just turn it around and throw it in the trash. The plastic spout also is a nice addition to the trash can. The lid is great.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This window film is beautiful.  It is wide and comfortable.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the film is a bit thin and the light is not as bright as the picture.  It is not clear in
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased this to inject some air into the chamber. I did not need a filter, just a suction cup. The suction cups are designed to be easy to use and clean. I do not know how many people have complained"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Good blanket, and it's as soft as the pillow cases. I will keep my blanket in this one. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I had a cheaper Sealer set and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's not.  I am glad I bought it.  It is very sturdy and it keeps my spices and spices safe. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great gift and we plan to use it for many years to come.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does the job.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Tried baking chocolate cupcake using this. The cake was just too thin and didn't hold as much. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,So expensive! But the material is nice and soft. I will keep my shelves in order and use them for extra storage. I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I've only used the large one for a few days and I'm still happy with the size and the quality. I had a similar model before and it was a bit more expensive, but now it's worth it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"The colors are exactly what I wanted and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy.  I would not recommend this product to"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"These work great, smooth pour, and have the suction and pressure of a lot of the other brands.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Not the highest quality by any means. It works and looks good. The corners are like blades that cut the legs of anyone unfortunate enough to walk too close. We had to buy padded bumpers to put on the front corners to avoid more pain and bloodshed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought to use as a smaller decorative piece for my cocktail table and I couldn't be more pleased with the item. The balls are brown, gold and cream which look just lovely on the wooden tray. Looks far more expensive than what I paid for it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my Vellux Blanket and have had them in the past.  I like that they are also great for allergies. That it is light weight, yet warm for the winter and light enough for the summer.

I will always have a Vellux ....

Thank you,
Kathy from California"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this for my son in Alaska.  So many places will not ship to Alaska.  My son said since he seasoned it, it has been great for taking it camping and for use at home.  I would recommend this company and this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,works flawlessly - quiet and 2 'just right' speeds.  a must-have kitchen tool  [1 example: what a breeze not having to 'process' my pea soup in messy batches - just puree whole pot instantly]  dropped a star as i've seen handsomer designs - -
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Bought for our tuft and needle king size mattress. We upgraded from a queen. This platform barely takes away space. So far no squeaks. Love the height, it's perfect for getting in and out of the bed. Also makes it easy to store things under the bed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Purchased to help make the switch from sippy cups to glass glasses for little ones. These are FANTASTIC. I love them and am even using them myself when I take a drink to go in the car. Wish they came in grown up styles. hint hint.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"It isn't bad, good for the price.  However, it is shipped folded in half, and rolled up, so it takes a while to flatten.  It is very light, so movement (even walking) on it, pulls it out from under the furniture and it bunches up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This product fit perfectly in the top of our ""bar-moire"".  I ordered 9 of them to span a 42 inch space.  Holds all different shapes and sizes of glasses including martini, champagne, red and white wine, etc.  Very easy to install and looks fab."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Wife likes them.  I was a little concerned after the first round through the dishwasher as one of the bowls developed a wobble instead of sitting flat on the counter.  It turned out the I needed to ""pop-it"" back out and is like new again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Porcelain really does keep it hotter...I used to use regular coffee cups when I did a Nespresso shot or two..It was always instantly cooled down..These help u enjoy it.  Also the set just looks cool and keeps it tightly organized with little effort....great buy for me
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I ordered two of these and one is a very tan color (as in the image) and one is dark brown. The inner parts are not at all finished and the quality just doesn't look very good. Spend a little more for something that will look good.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Yes, this mat is very expensive, but it was very important to my mother that there were no suction cups.  This mat prevents my dad from slipping in the tub, so it was worth the cost.  If Mom and Dad are happy, I am happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The only travel mug I have ever owned that truly does not leak, and my coffee stays hot.  Goes through the dishwasher with no apparent problems (so many that I have owned were hand wash or top rack safe only).  This mug is a winner!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This puts out very little oil. It's hard to tell if it's even working. The reason I can tell is that it sounds like it is boiling when it is on. There is definitely a boiling water sound, so I don't know that the ""whisper"" name applies."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I love these containers! They're perfect for the wide variety of containers you can make for the price!Great product. Great price! I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Don't know why I thought this would be the best. I did not need a filter, just a filter that would not open the lid.  The filter itself is a great deal, but it is a little difficult to open, especially"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Pound those eagle-sized chicken breasts and you'll be very pleased.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Purchased for my wife.  We have two dogs and she has a lot of allergies.  She likes to play in the open air, but sometimes she must be in the house.  We bought this for her and she loves"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,I do know I ordered this set because the picture is too large.  I thought I would just get two sets.  I am disappointed.  The plastic is not sturdy enough to hold it's weight in.  The cover is very
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Truly better than the picture.  I love the look.  My husband likes it too.  It is so colorful.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These were SO wonderful. The colors were so vibrant and bright. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the plastic parts were too small to fit into the holes in the frame. They had to be fixed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These pillows fit the Euro style. The design is comfortable and looks nice on my countertop. The color is bright and vibrant. The material is soft and soft, so it is not tacky. I love the color of the pillow"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm totally pleased with my purchase. The quality is just as advertised. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I bought the king size and it is the best. I will keep my king size as it is a little too large for my needs.  The king size is a great size and is comfortable to hold.  I would definitely buy this
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I'm sure my expectations are low. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I ordered these to span the holidays and they look just like the picture.  I am not sure how well they hold up but I think they are okay.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone.  It will be a perfect gift
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I was surprised by this little machine, as it is a little noisy, but I was just as pleased with the quality of the design.  The basic design is solid, and it is easy to clean.  It is a bit on"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Thoroughly disappointed. Purchased this pan for a professional cook and it was a disappointment.  I was disappointed.  If you want a nice, solid pan, the Teflon is the best pan you'll ever buy. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This cling is very detailed; it has the design of a thick fabric. It is very strong and sturdy. The top is a nice, solid piece of fabric. It does take a bit of work to get it to hang, but it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Made of solid wood, with a cutting board style top, this cart was a little smaller than I expected, but the quality was better than I expected. It's solid. There is some assembly required - about 45 minutes worth. Given the price, not a bad deal at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,These are great for the first few months. A few of my pieces (the whisk and spatula to be specific) have fallen a part and I have since had to throw them away. The tops of them start to slip off and won't stay on while you're cooking.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Very creaky.  Not a good buy.  The slats kept falling out because they weren't cut long enough.  You will probably have to get a metal platform base in addition to this frame.  I did.  Better to buy something else that's actually solid wood.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I love this scale its easy to use I need two! If I would have known that Bed Bath and Beyond also carried this brand I could have saved myself the shipping cost. There are several YouTube videos that will also help answer any questions you may have.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Found the colors to fade together to be a pale-ish light red rather than a distinguishable red and white check .  They are short, not at all generous.  Once baked, the colors is almost lost. Pulled away from baked goods avg. Won't opt to purchase again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Purchased for docking home pizzas, but also had in mind to use for docking convential pie dough.

This item works fine, but its considerably larger than expected making it difficult for use on just about anything except a large pizza. The size makes it a little difficult to store."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Finally........a bottle brush with bristles on the bottom.  You might have to twist and turn it a little to get into a small-necked item but it doesn't take much.  I hope it lasts forever but I know which one to buy again if I need it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The first thing you notice is how lightweight these are -- does not feel like glass, feels more like plastic. They come in a white unmarked box with no branding, no care instructions, and no indication whether they are microwave safe. But apart from that they seem ok."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a very sturdy steamer with nice features. I like the silicone-coated legs which prevent scratches in the pan, in fact, that is the reason I chose it. I use the steamer basket for hard cooking eggs. The detachable handle in the center is a premium feature."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,After I received these I realized that they go on the outside of the window. This will not work for my applications. I do like the maple leaf look so I was sad. I am sending this to the thrift shop and hope someone else can use it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are very nicely made. These are not originals, they are reprints which I believe is in the description. These are about 12"" square, with hangers already applied to the backs.
Disclaimer I received this set of 4 sea canvases at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"after checking all over for the perfect toaster, we found this one. It toasts to each family members likes. Easy to use, toasts large pieces bread.  Plug is in frount , little inconvienent, but can live with it. Amazon had the best price. would recomend this toaster"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a very, very sharp, very handy knife. I don't use it for paring (as I am not fond of serrated knives for that). I use it as a utility knife for any miscellaneous use. Seems like it will stay sharp for a long time. Well made."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Easy to put together took about 15 minutes solo.  Reasonably comfortable - not the best I've used but I like the look and it seems fine for my home office.  If I was sitting in it 6+ hours a day I'd probably go for something else.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The pan is just the right size to hold 4 pieces of bread when making French Toast.  The no stick feature is great making clean up a snap.  The aluminum body is rigid and does *not* warp or twist while cooking.  I highly recommend it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Exactly what I was hoping for. The quality is good but it's not really the best quality.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I checked out dozens of brands of suction cups and I saw this one. I was just starting to get used to the fact that I can get the suction cups to fall over without causing a huge mess. I even bought a set of

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I bought this for a small house and it's just what I needed for my small home. It is so small that it's not worth the extra money. This is great for storing rice or pasta. It's not heavy so it stays cold

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These were pretty nice. Much nicer than the original. We love this blanket. It's been one of our favorite blanket covers ever. We also bought the Tootle version and it's just as beautiful.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I had a hard time contacting the manufacturer/distributor in order to make sure the measurements were correct. The description and the .pdf have completely different dimensions.
In reality, these didn't fit at all. Extremely short!
Fabric is very thin. I consider these are well overpriced for what the product really is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Seemed to be just fine and then suddenly just quit working after about 6 months. Cleaned the terminals on battery, etc. Nope - it's a goner. Not my unit as I had the old Dyson battery. Charged it up and it runs my unit. Try another brand I guess."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It is cheap and works.  What else is there to know about this?  I have a small microwave and it fits, but barely.  So you might want to check the size of your microwave compared to this cover before buying if you have a small one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Works wonderfully. We have had for several months now and it is still going strong. I love the length of the cord it reaches much further. I love how much it picks up, very helpful since we deal with pet hair. Easy to empty and clean. Affordable and reliable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I really like this thermal. I don't put it in the microwave, though. I heat the water and then pour it in the thermal. I take it with me out in the cold and tea stays hot for hours. It won't spill in my bag at all!

Just love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Before putting this together, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SMALL SCREWDRIVER! And by small, I mean one that is 3"" or less in overall length!

With that out of the way, I love this tower!!! It looks great, works great, and is of very good quality. Well worth the money!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this storage cube to put all of my knitting in next to my couch. I couldn't use the lid because my wooden knitting loom was to large. So, I use the lid as a dinner tray. Works for me.

It's a solid construction. Worth the price, for sure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a must have for any kitchen. I had my previous splatter screen for so long and one day the screen just fell out. I saw this 3-Pack and just had to have it. The product is lightweight, good quality, and protects very well. Also a good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love these bottles. I make my coffee in the morning and bring it with me to,work,and it stays hot! I use the smaller one to have cold water during the day. Beautiful and stylish and the best of all they are amazing! They don't sweat and do their job!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,This little guy works pretty well!  I've had it for around two years now and it has held up to daily use in my house.  I'd definitely recommend it.  This can opener has held up better than any of the models I've owned in the past.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I LOVE these!!  I bought one set and came back and got another.  I used them on my front door wreaths and lighting on my porch for Christmas.  Since I live in Florida I don't use my fireplace but decorate it and these lights are perfect!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Super cute, but realistically I'm not sure how anyone makes these work as advertised.  I haven't tried them myself.  My 15 yr old daughter wanted these and after trying once and it being kind of a pain they are now just taking up space in my cupboard."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This Queen Sheet  collection is quite nice.  I will get back to my review after I wash them, the ultimate sheet test right?  It will be a surprise if these pill up - I was asked to give this review.  More when I wash them"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"They came in tact.  The latches are fine.  The latches are the slide-y kind.  Yeah, they aren't the BEST, but for storage of crap, they work fine.  I wouldn't store Grandma's heirloom china in them, but for my stock-piling of bathroom stuff, they work fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I like this grater.  It has the design and it is a nice piece of equipment.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the filter is adjustable so it can be used for both the water and the

I had to replace the attachments to get the plastic spacers to work properly.

The spacers were a little thin on one"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"This is a great idea, and it's an inexpensive addition to our kitchen!We have been using this for a long time and it works great. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that it's a little smaller than the size of the one"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This bundt pan arrived just as described and the pan is very sturdy.  The dimensions are just right.  The pan is very sturdy.  The pan is easy to clean and it does not require any special tools.  I would highly recommend
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Good chair, its held up well. The only problem is that its not really a comfortable chair, but a very sturdy one. I am not sure how the chair will hold up in the winter, but it is not really a problem."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This little collapsible stool is perfect for the wide variety of people who love to walk around and throw their hair in the trash. I am a firm believer that if you don't have a nice, deep gut, this will be your perfect stool."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I am pleased with the quality of the pieces. I will keep my review for future reference. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very pleased with it. It looks good in her bed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Since others mentioned that their spoons are too long and too thin, this is the first one I've seen.  The plastic spoons are also the first one I've purchased that does not have a handle.  The handle is very thick and"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Dirt Devil is under-rated. I've had it for a year and I still love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The light is not dimmable and it's easy to adjust it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I love the feel of this rug, the feel of the fabric and the color. I just wish it had a little more strength, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no idea that this was a bedsheet."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I bought these for my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" color; it was not flattering at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Good quality, however, the fit is not correct for the pot size.  It is wobbly and loose.  Okay for my uses.  Handle does get hot as cooking continues so caution is advised.  The hollow button metal handles don't seem to have as much as an issue."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I chose this set for the double heart disk, and it worked well.  I'm looking forward to trying out the flowers disks for Easter & Mothers Day.  A friend suggested using the five-petal flower disk with peanut butter cookie dough, and placing a chocolate chip in the center."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These worked great to make flavored ice cubes for my tea.  I love the size of them . The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays once they are frozen . Just make sure you have enough space in your freezer to let them set .
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,As good as the top ratings suggested. Does as excellent job with uniform grinding. My only tiny complaint is that I'd like to grind only 2 scoops at a time but 4 is the smallest. Not a big deal.  I'll likely give these as gifts to my coffee-loving friends.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It is pretty much what I expected, like anything new I am getting used to it.  Is is pretty easy to set up and I believe it will meet my expectations. The size of display is just fine, and I appreciate the moon phases, have not seen this before."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this rug pad to replace a open waffle-type rug pad that I had used for many years. My, how crappy the waffle-style pad is in comparison! This is easy to trim down to size with decent scissors, and it feels great underfoot. Also, there is absolutely zero slippage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Good quality, thick, shiny and it keeps my tea hot.  It is a good looking cup.  If you like big cups of coffee, this cup is not for you.  I have my big cup for morning coffee and I use this one for afternoon coffee or tea."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The Dreamaway Comfort Fill Mattress Protector was good for a while but then problems arose.  First was that the fill compressed in the center, which created a shallow dip in the center.  Next the top material pilled too much; some pilling was expected but this became too excessive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love this peeler.  I had purchased one a few years ago and somehow it got lost.  I tried to replace it with other brands and they just didn't do the job as well.  This time I purchased two just in case.  Would recommend it to everyone.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Have been using these (bought two) for a few weeks now and they are working nicely. Nice design. Don't even need the fancy controls, but the fan is nicely designed and cranks the flow of air nicely.

UPDATE: One has broke already!!! Stay away - more garbage I'm sorry to say!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is exactly what I needed for all of my shoes. The assembly of the unit was obvious and straight forward. No instructions were necessary though they were provided. I assembled with the leveling feet, which allow for the unit to withstand a greater load. Works perfectly for my needs."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It's a great rug for the bathroom!! Doesn't move at all on the tile and soaks up the water that goes onto the rug after you step on it from exiting the shower/bathtub. Wish the brand would make them in a larger size though.  Overall a great bathroom rug.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Upon opening these had a very strong chemical smell. After washing the smell went away.

After showing I used the towel and it wasn't very soft, it was soft enough but it didn't seem as absorbent as my regular use towels. These will work as guest room or backup towels though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Even better than the picture, and it's a very nice set.  I just wish the colors were a little brighter.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I've got a short neck and an open neck and these fit perfectly. They have a nice grain to them and they are a nice look. The neckline is nice too. I have had this product for about a year now.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"The other versions of this are a little bit more expensive but it's still a pretty decent one. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!  It's great for storing rice, pasta, and bread in the fridge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I got this dish in a gift and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money. This dish is very large and it is well made. It is a perfect size for my needs
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I needed a board to hang my curtains.  This is a nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money.  It is very large and it is well made.  The size is perfect for my needs
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These worked find for the price. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Upon opening the package, I noticed a small hole in the bottom of the lid, which was just a matter of finding the right spot, but that is the only thing I can say about this product.

The only thing I can say about this"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"This is not real wood, it is just a thin piece of wood that is hard to see.

I had to replace it.  The wood was not solid, it was rough.  I would not recommend this product.I use this as"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"these are very nice - nice colors and the finish is good. These are very strong and sturdy. I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal. I am a bit disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This was purchased for use in a small space and it is a nice piece of furniture. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money. It is very large so it is a little difficult to put together.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Originally I purchases this to go with the wide wooden legs of my Ikea. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The legs are tall enough to accommodate my larger desk and cabinets. It's a great addition to my office.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,We rented cabins at a discount for the fact that they are cold. They are warm and we have two. The bed is solid and is comfortable. It is very large so it is a little smaller than a queen bed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"The bowls are awesome, however, they are a little thin.  I wish they would have been a little thinner.  The bowls are solid and have a nice, solid feel.  The bowls are made of stainless steel.  They are also very"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Makes good popcorn!  Not a big fan of the stovetop, but this is a nice one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It does not stay in place."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Its a decent height for a standard 3"" tall mattress.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am not sure how the top will hold up in the winter, but it is not a problem.  The size is perfect"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Just the price and size for my wife and myself. I have cooked 7 meals since we bought it and its great.  The Crock comes out and goes right into the dishwasher as well as the cover.  Best Crock Pot we have had so far in many a year.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Because the spatula is molded in one piece, it is sturdy and easy to clean. It's not as flexible as my other spatulas, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem.  This thing is impervious to heat--you can use it in a pot or pan right on the stove."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a solid starter set for those who want to start pressure cooking, I would say that the pot its self is on the cheaper side but still a great product. I noticed that it can require some giggling to get the seals to take hold nd start building pressure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Works great. Plenty sharp and sets at a good angle for grating. The whole thing comes apart to make basically two different graters. I haven't had a problem with feeling cheap or feeling like it will break like some reviewers have noted.
Overall I'm pretty darned happy with this little kitchen gadget."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"This would hypothetically be a fantastic way to burn incense if it worked. However, incense will not stay lit when using this holder. You will have to light an incense 20 times for it to burn the entire way to the end of the stick. Stay far far away from this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Nice, small, good featured radio. Only thing I don t like is you cannot silently set the alarm, it makes some annoying beeps when you try to set it, at least I haven't figured out how not to. But it is a very nice clock and the radio sounds good too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,This is a awesome cup. Two things I found wrong with were when you get the hot coffee in it the mug gets really hot. The lid started to shed plastic right when we got it. I think if you could fix those two problems this would be a perfect mug.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was concerned by the other review that it might not fit and at first I put it on wrong but I got out the manual and followed it and it fit just right. Other reviewer may have had a real poor fit issue, though.  But now I can shred!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"NOT COPPER!!!!

This is a cheap stainless steel mug with copper plating on the outside. A TRUE Moscow Mule needs to be in a copper mug, not stainless. The picture and title are very deceiving. I returned mine when I got it. It also seemed much cheaper made than what is pictured."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I like the color on bottom for keeping track of your own glass.  The have a little waviness to the sides - I wasn't expecting that, but it doesn't really bother me.  They are a little fragile and they have a dip in the bottom that holds dishwasher water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Rugged and easy to mount. This bottle opener will get you into a crisp brew that much quicker. It will also save you a trip to the dentist for chipped teeth after trying to impress the ladies. I mounted mine to a wooden cooler I made and it hasn't disappointed yet!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great product - the timer ability sets it apart from average. Unfortunately, we purchased cool white, not realizing we needed warm white to match what we already have.  Still, this is a nice little light set and we'll find a way to use it in another setting."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"like someone else mentioned, this doesn't work with headphones....was on a long haul flight;  thank goodness i had my iPhone earbuds. yes,the designers of this pillow would to well to make a loop on one end of the pillow so it can be secured around the neck with those drawstrings."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I followed the washing instructions exactly, these sheets made a million fuzzy balls that get all over the bedroom. So, I thought to wash them again and hopefully be rid of the fuzz balls - nope, didn't help. Trashed em and went to Costco, bought a set I am delighted with."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Bought this to use in a commercial kitchen for hard to clean dishes. All employees used it when cleaning dishes and it got job done. Its durable as it wound up in garbage disposal a couple of times and was still usable. A two pack supply was nice for the money.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love these laundry baskets, especially for the price.  I also love that they are removable and can be removed.  The basket is easy to clean, and the baskets are very large.  They are great for packing laundry items, as well as for"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Better quality than expected. If you have the space to put it together, this is the one you will be using.  The plastic parts are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"After living near the seashore, I have found the comfortable fit of this pillow to be a great deal. I had to replace a couple of the pillow cases, so it is not that difficult to get this pillow out of the box."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great chair that was easy to assemble and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this chair to anyone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,The stopper pops out everytime I need it. I've had mine for a couple of years now and it's the best I've ever used. I use it to bring my rice to work and it's really handy.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Had one of these for a friend and she loved it.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small but the plastic is sturdy. I used it to make a little bread in the oven. It is very thin and"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I give these sheets a full thumbs up! At first I was a little worried because the rpice was so low, but I was pleasantly suprised when they arrived! These sheets are of good quality and the deep pockets fit my mattress and thick matress pad perfectly! The sheets are so soft!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Received the item before the shipping due date.  It is exactly what I wanted except for the tassel,  I wished it could have been taken out so I could place a real tassel in the frame.  Otherwise, great item for its price.  Look good hanging on the wall."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I like the durability of these, I am not sold on their oblong size. I bought these because I was under the impression that they fit in spice jars. They don't fit as well as I'd hoped. You need to do some manipulating which causes some of the measurement to fall out."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fabric shelves are as tight as a drum head, no sag.  Plenty of clearance space between shelves.  As a guy after I filled it with my shoes, I put my hats on the other shelves.  It takes a bit of perseverance to assemble, but it is built to last."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Ok I figured it out but the instructions need improvement for something this complicated just a diagram with letters when wood isn't lettered is a fail. I will probaly buy again as I know how to do it now and for me is what I need a few of these for reasons.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I feel like an idiot for living this long without a waffle maker. Oil that baby up before the first use then you are good to go for delicious breakfast. Next up to try is a mac and cheese waffle. Obviously this product is partially at fault for my newest weight gain.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Somehow I was doubtful. I wish this fork was in my hand decades ago. A work of art and science. It's so easy to cut things. If one hand is doing the work or you want to just make it easier, you will be thankful for this amazing, friendly fork. I promise."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"On the box it smells heavenly. But as I suspected, when it burns the scent is more like a burning perfume. Not as delicate as other incenses that I tried. This is just my opinion.
I keep them in my drawers and closet, and they scent beautifully without the need of lighten them!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"We used this on top of my husbands dresser. Our DVD player and cable box fit perfectly underneath. Downside is that now that we don't have a cable box, and just our slimline DVD/Blu-ray player, we don't need the height of the shelf but the silver posts are not adjustable in size."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I purchased this for new furniture that will be delivered later this week.  I am used to leather but this time purchased microfiber.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"It is lightweight... which is JUST what I wanted and I could not believe the color... it matches my aqua bedspread to a ""T"".  A little bigger than I thought it was going to be but... that just means that my cats can lay on it while I lay under it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"If you spin it too fast, the medicine tend to fall over.  Slightly higher dividers would help greatly with this.

Love that it has partitions - one for me, one for my husband, one for my son, one for common.

I have it it a corner cabinet as shown, and it fits great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is perfect to get press the liquid out of tofu. I love this thing. No more wasting lots of paper towels or putting something heavy on to the brick of tofu. You will have to tighten the screws for another 10 minutes after the First 15 mins. This press is amazing!

I had to replace the spout by hand and it took a lot of work to get it out.

I am very pleased with the quality of"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"These were perfect for outside use. The only problem is that they are small, so if you are a big person, they are not designed to hold the plastic cups. They were made of plastic and had no seams. I'm not sure why."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I used this to prop up a large tree and it was a nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it would be impractical to get around with it.  I used it to make a little makeshift tree outside a tree on a busy road and it

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Works wonderfully to date after a few months. This thing cooks an epic amount of rice. I haven't even been able to use all the crazy features on it yet. But all around solid product and it was at a great price point compared to other similar rice cookers when I bought it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased the green and light blue for the closetmaid cubical organizer for my son's room. This color assortment looks great and the drawers are very nice to have. I use them to hold his socks, extra diaper creams, and other small items that need to be kept in a drawer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is such a cute spoon rest.  When stirring my coffee, I was always laying the spoon on the counter.  Now I have this next to my coffeemaker so no more coffee spots on the counter.  I haven't tried using it for anything larger than a regular size table spoon."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Came well packaged and undamaged. It does need 3 D-cell batteries, which do not come with it but no big deal. I like how the trash bag can be hidden so all you see is the trash can itself, which looks really nice. It is nice and big and the sensor works well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,The picture posted for this item is a fraud. It shows 3 pots and 2 pans with 2 lids. What you actually get are 3 pots and 2 lids.  It is very deceptive and this company should be ashamed. To return it you have to pay a 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This rack expands out to twice it's length, and you can fit shoes underneath it - so it ends up holding GOBS of shoes.  Great for a front hallway.  When extended out to it's max, it's easily 4.5-5 feet long.  Easy to put together and a total front hall saver!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"excellent bins!!!  I bought 8!  stacked them for 4 high for travel items for trips, cruises--and the other stack was for my many purses---everything is now sorted and so easy to get to.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"you do not need kindling or paper to start a fire with these.  Just break off two pieces, put them between some wood (or bio bricks) and light it.  Great product.  I bought beginning of the season and still have 3/4 of a box left.  Great value, great price"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am happy with this scale. The tare function works as advertised, the unit is attractive and has a small enough footprint that it does not take up unnecessary space. The readout is easy to see and it is totally easy to use. I did a smart thing when I ordered this one!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love the dinner plates. They are a nice size and I would describe them as very sleek and trendy..  They are not very heavy. But that is good for me. They stack nicely in my cabinet and don't take up much space. My daughter love them and wanted to order a set.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Unlike other similar signs, this one is of excellent indoor/outdoor quality.  The rugged look is perfect for our son-in-law's Colorado hunting cabin.  I really cannot wait to give it to him on his birthday...in fact, he may get it tonight!  Any hunter would love to display this!  Thank you!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Not happy with this product. I left plenty of space around it and it has more dust sticking to the outside than the filter. It doesn't take long for the replacement filter light to come on and the filters are very expensive. I can't say I have noticed a change since using it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I had these dishes previously in another color and when I decided to change the color scheme in my kitchen I went looking for new dishes.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This has been a nice little grill for making family breakfast. I like that it is none stick and has the cooling boundary around it. Bacon takes a while to cook on it but pancakes and eggs are fast. Decent to clean, wish it was dish washer safe. Over all very happy with it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love it! Love the size, have it over tv with a dark blue night-light bulb inside (looks aqua when reflected through the white star). Will eventually put in a changing light.

I would definitely recommend this towel to anyone that is a serious beach/pool person. You won't be disappointed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This product was a disappointment. I was surprised by how light the box was. I couldn't understand until I opened it. The inside of the bean bag chair seems to be a form of styrofoam shipping peanuts. The outside of the bag is not much better - very low quality ""suede"". Not worth the money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I read the review and decided to order. This is a realy nice screen - good quality - sturdy 4 panel.
The item was well packaged and arrived with no scratches or issues. No assembly - out of the box and put in place.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These canisters are the perfect size for us. We use the smallest one for powdered creamer, the middle size for instant coffee, and the largest size for sugar (which we use to refill our smaller sugar bowl). I wanted some canisters to match the butterfly garden dish ware and these are working just as I'd hoped."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,love it. it looks great in my kitchen and holds a ton. i had a wooden book shelf but it was buckling under the weight of the cans. love this one and it is customizable. we bought 2 and put half of the shelves from the second one on the first so we had more storage.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"What can I say....it holds ice.  These are handy to have but hard to find, so I was glad to see these listed at Amazon.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This product works just as described! Will fold your shirt just like you see in the department stores. Super easy and doesn't take any more time than folding without it. Allows a tighter fold so you can store more in one space. I put off buying this and wish I had bought it a lot sooner.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fantastic. A little heavier than I expected, but that just means it's very solid with thick walls and bottom. Not seasoned well and it took a lot of extra seasoning to make it non-stick. Made a baked ziti in it after it was seasoned and it was great! Cleaned great and the ziti came out better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have only used it twice so far but it is super easy and makes incredibly tasty yogurt. I have only used the organic store bought plain for a starter but it has been good. Easy set up, clean up and saves a ton on those little 5oz cartons that we were eating up so quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Great looks but the design is really poor.  Water gets stuck under the bottle, which rusts the bottom.  Mine is already leaking.  I can't imagine why they could not make a bottle that is attached to the caddy, and allow drainage in the caddy part of this soap dispenser.  I'm very disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"For the price, these are a great addition to my kitchen. I also have a large one in my bathroom. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash. The color is beautiful and the color is a perfect match for my decor."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I use this almost every day. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on.  The plastic part is also hard to put on.  I used to go through a couple of times a day, and it was hard to put it back on."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I understand you get what you pay for.  But I will admit that I have been using this product for about a year now.  I have had no issues with it breaking, but it is a little difficult to clean.  If you are going to use it for cooking,"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a classy looking stand -- now it is not tall enough for the Lladro ornaments, so measure carefully.  I put a 4.5 inch crystal, three dimensional, sun-catcher type ornament in mine and it is so pretty and sturdy too.  My daughter keeps hinting that she would like to have it -- too bad."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Beautiful set. Sadly, one of the bowls was broken on arrival. It would be a good thing if the inside of the box had a layer of small bubble wrap or something.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I got this for a friend who's 20 year old cat had died.  It is a nice gift for those of us who have our cat or dog as part of our family. I don't know if there is dimensions on the picture part but it only holds a very small picture. The poem is perfect.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"For the price and the fact that this is an entry-level model, this works for what I need. It's not THAT loud, on the lowest setting it's very quiet, less noise than a white noise machine would produce. Level two sounds like a regular desk fan, and level three is quite loud akin to a portable vacuum."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I had my local honey stored in a mason jar but it was so messy with the basic ring cap. Every time I tried to get a spoonful it made a mess. This is so much cleaner, and popping it into place in the lid was easy. It looks nice sitting on my counter too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I really like these candles. They look real, they have a nice vanilla scent. You can't use these to scent your space as they are very mild, but they are very pretty. I used them with pine branches at my Christmas party and people thought the flames were too close to the branches and would catch fire!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Beautiful in appearance. Very comfy to sit on and use as a guest bed. Disappointed in 1 of the arms that had several  (actually 4) cracks in the arm of the futon. Husband put it together , and didn't notice them until it was fully assembled. Too much trouble to take apart, repackage and send back."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are really wonderful. They are perfect for strawberry hulling neatly and easily. I've owned a dozen.  Not because they wear out; they don't.  They just seem to wander away when I'm not looking . . . .
Fortunately, they're not expensive, and Amazon seems to alway have them in stock.

A must for good homekeeping 101."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,We used it for a party.  After the party we put the sever in the refrigerator and used it a few days later for another party.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I order this through prime now... this is the third one this year. It smells horribly of plastic on the highest setting, and they eventually break.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These shelf liners are handy - sized and formed to fit the shelf perfectly!  The reason for four stars and not five is they're a bit thin; that makes them easy for the vendor to pack and send but does raise the question of how durable they'll be.  Other than that concern about durability, just right!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"This works well and sucking gunk out of window sills.  However, it will NOT charge.  It only worked for 5 weeks and now will not charge.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I used this to protect a 7 inch Santoku knife. But I never felt that this guard was very securely on. Even cut my finger once when inserting the knife because the knife edge passed through the top of the guard and my finger was there.

Not heavy, 3 year old gave me a scare when he opened all of the drawers and this thing fell forward thank goodness the room is narrow and the bed managed to save him it landed on bed. Anyway If this is for a kids room get something sturdy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Ended up buying 2 of these. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received from the company is the most defective. The box was not filled with enough suction to make it hard to get the carpet out of the car. This is a problem that should be

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Very soft and light weight.
I use it as a nightstand for my bed, and I have one in my bathroom.  The bed is solid and is light and attractive.  I love that it is made in China.  I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I use this thing all the time and it's just what I needed for my kitchen.  It is so easy to use and so easy to clean!  I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect addition.  I love that it has a full sized blade
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Very beautiful, works of art, and has the quality to match the decor.Nice, sturdy, and functional.  Great for the price.  Not too big or too small.  The only thing I would change is to cut the center pieces.  This is a great product. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Have had these glasses for a couple of years now and I really love them. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The glass is a nice white color and the color is beautiful. It does not have a removable lid. This glass is very well made and the silver

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Love the design, function, and looks. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the same bed sheets.  The box itself is a cardboard box, so it's a little difficult to open, but it does the job.  I ordered two for"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I have used a downer for the last 10 years and it works great. I have one in my bathroom and the other in the office. The light is not dimmable and it does not affect my bathroom. It is a perfect size for my bathroom and is perfect for showering.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This is a great rug, it feels great and is very comfortable. I have a large one and a small one. The rug is solid and is well made. It is very soft and comfortable. I would highly recommend this rug.I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"""
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I purchased these curtains to go up in my living room to help block some of the light the comes in through our large window. The curtains are of great quality material, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how nice they were. They're also made of a nice heavy fabric that does a great job of blocking out light."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Needed just a little more storage in our bathroom, and decided to put this over a hook on the bathroom door as it was a little heavy, and I wasn't sure the new shower head would hold it. This turned out to be a great holder from my make up and looks very nice. Very sturdy and well made."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Can't be beat for the price.  We use this as a display case for polish and other sale items in our salon.  No internal lighting but with so much glass you don't really need lights.  Went together easily.  Top & bottom are cheap pressed material but you don't really notice them as they are thin.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It has a horrible strong chemical and plastic smell that doesn't go away even after being washed with soap several times. I also tried leaving soaking in water with dishwashing soap for four days and the strong chemucsl and plastic smell remains. The bad thing is that the odor gets into the Q-Tips.

Beautiful design but not good product materials."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love this product. I use the larger fan in my exercise room and get a wide reach and instant cooling. The price is well worth the quality of the device. The smaller fan is perfect for my office where my AC is not as powerful for some reason. Overall, highly recommended for its quality, cost and practical application."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We got these dishes for our motorhome. Not only were they priced right and durable, what they were made of and where they were made were also huge factors in our purchase. We used these dishes every day  for a 2 1/2 month travel trip. They held up great. I am looking forward to using them next summer."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I would give this zero stars if I could.  It opened THREE normal sized cans - very, very, very slowly.  Then it stopped working and just made clicking sounds.  Absolutely worthless piece of junk.  The concept is good, and I think others make better ones.  But this one was a total waste of $20."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This tripod for the price is good. It is short but I knew that when I bought it and then I just bought 3 pieces of  half inch steel gas pipe, 7 feet in length for about $20 from Lowes and slide them over the original tripod legs and now I have a nice tall tripod. Works great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,I was looking for a simple inexpensive butter dish to replace the one broken by my dog. This one is a mite small and does squish the corners of the butter but it does the job. If you have twenty bucks or so to spend buy a better butter dish. If not you'll find this one to be adequate.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I got these for my moms Kirby and they fit perfectly. The quality was also good, I had bought some off brand belts and they snapped easily when I vacuumed up my mom and my long hair. With these bands so far so good. It was also cheaper to get these here on amazon than in the local shop."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Well, I gathered all my moth traps up at the end of the summer and looked in them to find the Safer (darn-it more expensive) traps had captured way more moths than the other brands.  Can't argue there.  I do wonder though, why the pheromone thing has been made even smaller?? Still, I want to pay less!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"When the shower curtain arrived, it was a very comfortable fit.  The shower curtain was just what I wanted.  The shower curtain is very clear, and the cover is very soft.  The material is very absorbent, which is a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I was so excited to find this item.  I was expecting a lot of the other one.  I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Compared to a older prior, this is the best. I will keep my old one as a backup. If you want a nice, solid stainless steel dish, this is it.I have used this product twice and it worked great. The first time I used it to make yogurt, the yogurt was"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have had this Presto for a couple of months and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The Presto is a great little vacuum that takes up little space. It is a little bit noisy but it is worth it. The reviews said it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I really like the look of this, the materials are thick and sturdy, and the handle is sturdy.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.  I am a bit disappointed.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This product is Great to use for the summer and winter.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am using it for the shoulders of my neck and shoulders for my shoulders.  It does not have a removable neck strap.  I like the fact that the straps are
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These scottish terriers are very nice. The only problem is that they are also very hard to find.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back, so it was perfect for her. She has two sons,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,This was disappointing. I loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the suction to run smoothly. The suction is so great it's like it's a little smaller than a regular pillow. I wish it was a little thicker.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This cabinet is awesome and looks great in the kitchen. I will definitely be buying more!I am a big fan of the plastic ones. The plastic ones are so great, it's worth the extra money. The plastic ones are also very thin and don't hold much weight."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased one of these for my daughter as a gift for her father who is a strong and strong woman. She loves it. The attachments are small, but the cover is strong and thick. It is great for packing a large container of coffee.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I like this product.  It has the design and it is a nice size for the size of the cup.  It is also a bit small for the cup holder.  I would definitely recommend this product.Love it. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Absolutely love this slushie machine. We.use it for our home theater room to make icees on movie nights, just like at the theater. Works great, as long as you READ and FOLLOW the directions. We liked out so well that we actually bought another one so that we could make two flavors on movie night. Love making mountain few icees!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Bought this for the sleeper couch in our RV.  It's pretty thin but still seems to work great and it stores beneath the couch so it's out of the way.  It hasn't been tried out for a full night's sleep yet.  The cover and straps are nice.  It's almost a perfect fit, just a tad short."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"They are affordable and easy to use. The quality is excellent for the price! I've used this product for ~1 year now, and no bag has ever teared on me while decorating sweets.
They fit well with all of the piping tips I have, including couplers. The seam on the side of the bag makes it easy to mark and cut!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"If you have a window AC, this is a must for off-season storage. If you keep your AC in the window year-round, I highly recommend this cover. It will keep dust out of the vents as well as aiding an outside cover in keeping out cold drafts. It's a lot nicer than covering the AC with sheet plastic and towels."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a really good cutting board set. The only issue I have with it (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that there's a board missing for poultry. There's one for vegetables, fish and beef but not for poultry. There's a white board with some icon of soup or something...not sure what its supposed to be used for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This cannister is exactly what it says it is. Easy to open and close and has a liner that is removeable and easy to wash. Doesn't show finger prints at all and wipes clean if you spill anything on it without having to polish marks off where it was handled. Very well made and stylish looking out on the counter.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"If you own other Shun's you know this is going to an awesome product.  I have a fairly heavy cleaver that I use mainly for breaking through bones and connecting joints, but this beauty takes all the work out of slicing through whole celery bunches to evenly julienning ginger.  Definitely a must use tool in my knife arsenal"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Most cabinet liners are good quality but come in ugly colors, or have cute patterns but are basically sheets of paper. Get this! It has an adorable pattern that we used in all our bathrooms and cabinets. It's a little surprise every time you open the drawer our door. The rubber material keeps all the products in place without shifting."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a nicely constructed vinyl tablecloth with a soft backing underneath. It works well, cleans up easily, and gives a nice touch to a less formal party. MAKE SURE TO OPEN IT A FEW DAYS BEFORE because the plastic smell is *really* strong and needs some time to dissipate. It also helps the folds fall out a little better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I like everything about this clock. I like the illumination, I like the look of it, and I really like the alarm that gets louder and louder as it sounds. If you are looking for an alarm clock that you don't have to wind up, look no further. It's a Seiko and that has come to mean dependable to me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I am furious. I waited months to buy this as it was on my Xmas list. Didnt get it as a gift so I bought it for myself the next day. Arrived with missing pieces. I am missing a screw and its pointless. The most expensive little shelf and they cant even count the screws right. Beyond mad right now.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My Roomba was only running for a short time, and I didn't notice any problems. It is so easy to use. Easy to clean, and the cover is very sturdy. It is hard to open, so it will be hard for me to open it again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"A must have. Nothing sticks to it, and it stays put.  If you have a small kitchen, this is the dishwasher most likely to get the job done.  I used this to make a couple of cups of coffee, and it worked great.  I used it for a couple of"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I have 3 floors of this rug and the only thing I didn't like is the way the rug is so small. The rug is designed to be light and not so great looking. The color is a little darker in the picture, but it's ok.I purchased this for my husband and it's"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Terrible disappointment. After one year, it's just too thin for my liking. I'd been using it for two years and it's still working fine. The plastic is a bit dull and the coating is a little thin. I'm not sure why.I bought this to replace a broken one I"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"These are not the finest, but I thought they would be better.  They are a bit lighter than I expected, but I am happy with them.I bought this to put in my oven.  It is a good size, and it is easy to use.  The handle is a nice looking"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Only thing I don't like is the suction on the bottom of the cup. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The suction is not great and it's difficult to get it to be fixed in a matter of seconds. This is a problem for me.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Pleated patio-door curtains are almost impossible to find in stores anymore, and my 86-year-old mother was not (NOT!) up to changing her travis rod to accommodate anything else.  I ironed the large panel with medium-hot iron to get most of the wrinkles out, and it looks fine.  Size was perfect, and she is happy ... which makes me happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This serves the purpose that it was designed to do, and was delivered promptly. It is as described. However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inforced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a great menorah depending on what your needs are.  Traveling during Hanukkah? This will fit perfectly in your suitcase and will be great in a hotel.  Small living space? Perfect size.  Obviously this is not going to be an heirloom quality piece, but in a pinch it's perfect!  Standard birthday candles will fit with this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Meh. Rug does not resemble photos, colors are much deeper and stand out more. Quality seems to be OK, but certainly not so great for the price point. If you need an area rug, it will do....but its much more difficult to incorporate ANYTHING other than neutral colors. Would not recommend for the price, and if i could return? I would."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love these racks. My mom also makes jerky bought her a set of them for christmas. I can fit 3-3.5 lbs of jerky on these racks. I bought an oven thermometer and keep the oven temp at 160, put a wooden spoon in the oven door so the moist warm air can escape and then leave it for 6-8 hours."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Corelle isn't luxurious, but it's sturdy as can be.  That's why I like it so much.  Flatware doesn't leave marks on it, it doesn't chip, scratch, or crack in normal use.  I purchased this set as a gift to someone else; but my own set looks like the day I bought it perhaps six or more years ago."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a very nice set of dishes, and you can store them all in the lunch container. I took it to lunch today and I really like the plates.  Only they are not spill proof really.  Today my bag was soaked and I just cleaned it when I came home.  Ready to go again for another day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love the clear sides to view contents, and I love the way the dividers give flexibility in what size divisions are chosen.  The product walks the line between organizing content and losing storage space very nicely and feels durable enough to withstand being stored in a dusty basement.  I plan to purchase another one of these next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I didn't get to try this knife before buying but a friend recommended it so I decided to give it a try. I was worried that it might be too heavy or big for my small hands. It's actually very light but feels solid and comfortable. I've had no trouble cutting all sorts of vegetables, fruits, and meat. A good purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I didn't want these cuz they sat so low but I am finding out that they are perfect for outdoor use.  They spill less because they have a lower threshold.  Perfect tumblers for Jacuzzi and bbqing.  I wash them in dishwasher but many just rinse by hand so they last longer.  Haven't had trouble with them yet
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Traditionally, we have duck for Christmas. Instead of cutting the duck with a knife, we just cut it in half with scissors and drape one half of a duck on a plate with dumplings and red cabbage - German style :) These scissors worked really well. So if you are looking for a pair of good poultry scissors you have arrived!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,Bought these for our daughter's room. The quality is good and she loves them. She does not mind them so much. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,I thought with as large a set as this one you'd need a lot of storage.  It is so small that it's not worth the extra money.  It is very large and it's a little smaller than the size of the one I ordered.  But it's not the size I'd expect
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Excellent Product: sturdy, thin, easy to assemble, and very comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very flimsy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"These aren't quite non-stick, but they do the job. I'm not sure how I would recommend them. I had a plastic spatula that broke when I got mine, and it's still working. It's a little thin, but it's not worth it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Most hotels nowadays aren't even close to the quality of these.

The only reason I'm giving them 5 stars is because I don't want to have to spend more money on these.

The only reason I give it 5 stars is because I really don't want to have to pay a lot"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Beautiful pillow covers. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this purchase. It's been one of my favorite pillow covers ever. I also bought the Tumbler for my bed so it's a little smaller. I'm very pleased with the quality of this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,These water filters were perfect for me and the only thing I didn't like is the way the water is filtered.  The plastic filters are also very light and not strong.  The only thing I would change is to buy a filter that can be easily cleaned with a wipe clean.  I would definitely recommend
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I received this fruit bowl at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. With saying that I am very impressed with the quality of this bowl and it's a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be which is great! The stainless steel matches my kitchen flawlessly and holds quiet a bit of fruit! I would highly recommend.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I like the dirt finder, and I just keep the vacuum running where it finds dirt until the light change. It also pick up dog and cat hair pretty good. Having a bag, that means I don't need to touch the dirt and dust again unlike the bag less type, you have to clean it and wash it when it gets clogged."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I needed a gift for someone I see socially and yet keep it light and kind of funny.  Knowing she loves wine and has a great sense of humor...this was perfect.  She loved it and it really does look a little more expensive than it is and also I love to personalize a gift and this fit into all categories.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"My only complaint is that it turns out I didn't need so many bags (because one bag holds so much) and it's hard to get the leftover bags back in the box (maybe I should vacuum them up inside each other). Does everything you expect it to. Holds a lot, gets really compact when vacuumed. So far, it has held the seal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought these because we have a parrot so we can't use anything that emits ptfa or pfoa. These were the only nonstick pans that I could find that we're safe for my family and our parrot. I will never buy a different brand of skillets again... I really hope they make sauce pans and a stock pot in the near future!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"While the boxes are nice, the clasps that hook onto the cover or another container are flimsy and break easily.  I WASN'T a happy camper when carrying the whole contraption down to the basement and the cover popped off because of a broken clasp.  Fortunately, only 4 ornaments broke.  I will be buying a different storage container next year."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I needed a larger tea kettle and liked the looks of this one. I was changing for another reason also, that the handle became very hot when it was used so I was hoping for a handle that remained cooler. However, this is not the case, but I still like its looks and just use a potholder when boiling water for tea."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I am new to loose leaf teas.  I like that the handles fold in when storing.  The mesh is fine and I barely get any tea leaf floaties in my tea compared to an old tea ball infuser that I once had.  The seller sent a nice e-book with recipes and tips that I found to be very helpful.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Ditch the rolling pin or heavy plates or whatever else you use to flatten out tortilla dough.  I sandwich the dough ball in this press between 2 layers of parchment paper, flip the handle over and press it down--it's quick and effortless.  Sopes or thin tortillas, I can easily control the thickness and always get a nice, round, uniform shape."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"the blade can pop off easily. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to slide the blade from the blades to the blade.  The blade itself is a bit dull, but it's okay.  It's a nice, thick blade.  I like the shape of the blade a lot.
"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I orginaly thought this was a good size for the price but it's not. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The ring is not sturdy and it's not worth the money. It's just a thin plastic one.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Trust me when I tell you it's a very comfortable chair. I have a large one and a small one. I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to get it to do what it is supposed to do. The machine works well.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I really do like this pillow.  It's comfortable and it's also a very strong pill.  I am very happy with the quality and the price.  I would definitely recommend this pillow.  It's a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I got 2 of these and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple years. Love it. The plastic is solid and is easy to clean. The color is nice. I had this for a few months, and it was perfect. I ordered two for the party."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Absolutely love this coffee maker. I love the taste and the smoothness of the coffee. It is so easy to use. I also like the fact that the espresso maker can be used to brew coffee at a time without having to use the coffee maker. I would definitely buy again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This works better than my old ones, but the instructions are a little difficult to read.  The bottom is too short and the lid is too tall, making it difficult to get it to go over the top of the lid.  The size is too small for my liking.  I haven't used it yet"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"We got this just in time for the holidays and it was perfect. It's been one of my favorite summer drinks!  The glass is clear, and the inside is very pretty. It is still very attractive, so it will be useful for decorating my house. I love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Average performance, average weight, average height. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best vacuum bags I have ever owned.  I was very pleased with this purchase.  It's a very nice vacuum.  I really like it.Great for the price. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Everyone knows that to make a steak, you have to take a lot of pressure off the edge.

I had to get a steak knife out of the box to slice it. The knife came out great.

I am very pleased with the quality of the knives. The quality of the knives is excellent"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Very reliable. Originally purchased years ago for my apt, and when I moved, I bought a new one for a new home because (and this is my only complaint), the screws attaching it to the cabinet floor had rusted and stripped shut. The sliding mechanism, however, lasted years without oiling, and took tonnes of abuse and has never failed. Dead easy to install."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"PRO Great product. Lids are tight. Almost too tight at times, hard to open. I Have dropped soup filled containers and container did not open.
Con wish they did not come with all the smaller containers. I need more big size containers than the small ones, I measure out dips and use for dipping sauces...Nice to not have to search for the matching lids!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So far I'm liking it. A bit larger than expected but I've never had a futon before so I had no idea what to expect. Took a bit longer to assemble than some people here stated but I must be really slow, LOL! Just have to make sure you follow the directions but otherwise no issues. Time will tell how it holds up..."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The magnets weren't strong enough to hold it up on the side of the fridge.  It kept sliding down. So I found a set of magnetic refrigerator hooks that had a super strong magnet on the back and put it under the coffee pod holder. It works fine now. I wish I could use the magnetic hooks for their original purpose, though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I REALLY love steaming my clothes over ironing. It's so, so, sooo much faster/easier. Less hassle by far. This is a great/handy steamer. I travel with mine, only thing is to keep it up right (or drain it) so the water does not leak out of the container when bounced around in a suitcase. But other than that totally satisfied with the product!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I actually purchased these because of the lid and the infrared open. This was to keep my dog out of the garbage. Looks great. Opening works great. Easy to use. (On another note, it took less than two days for my very smart dog to realize she only had to put her very long snout over the red light to open the can!)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This little tree adds extra holiday cheer to my living room in December. It comes with little gold ornaments and is pre-lit, so I just added some of my own decorations to finish the piece. My only issue is that some of the bulbs don't work and the lights aren't very bright. I added some extra lights of my own and it's great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I was about to purchase this item until I noticed that ALL BUT 2 of their feedback ratings are all listed within a day or two of each other.  If you click on each reviewer, you will see they have only reviewed this one item in their entire history.  6 of 8 of the reviews here clearly seem to be illegitimate."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love this product not because I'm only a gadget freak, but also because they have the following features:
- Countdown Timer
- Target Day Countdown Timer (up to 8 years ahead)
- Clock (12/24 hour format?)
- Count up (like a stopwatch)
- All features except the clock has a timing resolution of day:hour:min:sec:1/100 sec

Everything has met my expectations and I was very satisfied with the product!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I fully intend to buy more of this line of cookware! I've never used the All-Clad brand, but this pot functions so well I can't imagine spending over twice as much on All-Clad. The handles are very sturdy and the pot heats very evenly. I can't believe I used the garbage I had in my college apartment for as long as I did!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These towels are great. I use them as a long-term blanket or for my small baby shower. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"great price, does the job, has the right height and is easy to clean. I would recommend.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"just got today, was well received. The quality is good, it's a beautiful yellow color and the finish is great. The only thing I wish is the plastic lid was a little tighter so it could be washed. It would be nice if it was a little more snug. Great for the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was looking for the perfect size and quality, and this is it!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet.  The plastic is sturdy, and it's easy to clean.  It's a perfect size for my collection and is perfect for my needs.  I'm very happy with"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Works as expected. I use it as a long-term cold storage container for frozen fruit and vegetables. I love the fact that it can hold the contents of a small container and that it's easy to clean. I would highly recommend. This was a gift for my daughter.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I had purchased this with a set of four sheets. I did not need a set of 4. I had purchased the same set of sheets with the same sheets, so it was not necessary to purchase a set of 4. I would have liked to have had a set of 4 sheets with the same sheets as my current"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I got my new bread machine and it was very easy to assemble. The dimensions were exactly what I was looking for. The pan is very light and easy to clean. The coating is well made and the machine is a bit messy. I will be ordering another for the kitchen.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My microwave was too large and bulky, so I decided to try a smaller microwave. I'm very pleased with this purchase! I am using it for the first time in a microwave and it works great. It is a good size for the size I need and is easy to clean. I love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This thing is huge! And it has the design to make it a nice, cozy, warm cup. I had to replace a couple of the plastic cups, so it is not that big of a deal. But it is a nice size and holds a lot of liquid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"No rocket science here, just what I wanted.  The two-piece lid is a nice touch.  The top is a nice, solid piece of plastic.  It is very sturdy and holds a lot of things in it.  The size is perfect for me.  The handle is a nice touch too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"When we opened the box it was like being hit with Christmas, it smelled so good.  They were thick & full & beautiful.  The one we hung outside lasted much, much longer than the one we hung inside.  But I know we will order two again next year and hang them in the same places because they looked and smelled fantastic!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Super scratchy fabric. I was anticipating something a little softer. Still, the print is great and so far the pillow case is holding up after being laid on a few times. I'm pretty happy with the colors and the case looks exactly as it's advertised. It was folded in a small square for delivery and I had to iron it to make it smooth."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The lid didn't really pour correctly, it dribbled everywhere and flopped off.  I finally threw the lid away and just kept the pitcher part. This product is okay but nothing great. The business that sold it shipped it promptly and it arrived in a timely manner, it arrived unbroken and in good condition, it looks like the photo.  This review is lukewarm."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have tried to post pics several times showing the curve and with measuring tape so exact size can be seen; but these are only posted to my review page, and not under the public review section.  Not sure why.  This feather is large but I wish it was straighter.  The curve makes it a bit tough to use as desired."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Solid, easy to put together, and the pieces snap into place and are moveable too. A good buy. I'm using this as art room storage, and I've bought Seville before, will buy again. The only negative is the packaging, it's a bit hard to get open, but once you've gotten through that it's easy to put together and solid useful storage. A good buy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I use these in my closet to hang my clothes and jacket.  They work well and hold well.  The forever classic large metal hook fit and finish is excellent.  They look more expensive than they are.  The hook itself is a bit shallower than I would prefer, but they work well.  I did not want the more pointier ones."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The size is exactly what I need.  It serves the purpose, however, it has to be treated very gently, being careful not to break the plastic hinges or to have bottles flying around when pulling out the drawers.  Plastic bottles work better because they are not as heavy. The idea is good and would be better if it were made of metal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This chair side table is just perfect for me. There are shelves for my remotes, magazines, eyeglasses and whatever else. Leaves the top shelf free for drinks and snacks. It was easy to assemble. The directions sheet was informative and listed all of the hardware so you know everything is there. I'm glad I made this purchase. Works just fine for me. Thank you."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Arrived as stated when ordered.  Works as expected.  Able to keep in place and able to turn over easily.  Will not know how effective until I have had it longer but expect it to be better than a regular small pillow that I was using.  Appears well made and like that the cover fits well and is removable for washing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are the SOFTEST sheets I've ever slept on! I heard microfiber sheets are better for people w/allergies and they don't trap moisture like cotton sheets, so you don't wake up during the night hot/cold, hot/cold. They are lightweight and seem very well made so I give them 5 stars on both--I'm hoping after a few washings I can say the same about durability!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I just received package today, and it arrived with a very small opening.  The dimensions were not what I expected.  The plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very large.  The opening is not in good shape, and it's not very secure.  The packaging is not exactly accurate, but I"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I used this to travel with my husband and we both loved it.  It's been a great addition to our RV and I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I waited until I had time to make the recipe. I did not need to make the cup. I just needed the cup. The instructions said to have a ""good"" cup, but it was a little smaller than I wanted. The size was perfect. I was happy with the quality of the product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Bought this for my mother and she loves it!Very good quality.Nice, sturdy, and functional.  Great for the price.  Not too big or too small.  The only thing I would change is to cut the base from one side.  Otherwise it works very well.  I would buy again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was given a free sample of the product and it was a nice surprise. I was surprised to find that the packaging was very sturdy. The clear plastic was a nice touch. The metal coating was a little thin, but I would think it would hold up to some use. The machine works well. I have used the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"This thing is pretty bad, it doesn't feel comfortable. I also have a hard time using it when I want to get up. The light is not strong enough to go off when I need to. I'm not sure why. I don't know how long it will last."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great drying rack. Fits in my laundry room. Great quality.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the mesh filter is so large that it is not a very good filter"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Just used for Thanksgiving.  We have had the same pans for about a year now and have used them twice.  They are the most solid and sturdy pans we have had.  They are easy to clean and dishwasher safe.  The size is perfect for me.  The handle is long enough to hold a medium
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"The Spectrum 47710 wine rack (Cordova) is a great product for the price.  The rack is adjustable and can be used for wine bottles, cans, and a lot more.  The rack is easy to clean and it comes with a set of 4 screws.  The rack is a bit difficult to"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"As the title states, it does its job decently (It could be better) but it is really flimsy. After applying pressure to it you have to trace it back with something otherwise you won't be able to notice the shape. I used it for a couple of times VERY carefully and it broke anyways, so caveat emptor.

Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Nice shoulders, but the pants bars do not have any grippy coating as advertised.  The pants fall off pretty easily.  I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.  I bought these for the suit coats, and they preserve the shape on those supremely well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This drying rack is a work of art.  Beautifully made of hard rock maple and finished to perfection.  All edges are rounded and smooth; no splinters. The dowels are thick and sturdy so no sagging.  Heirloom quality; would be great for displaying quilts.  And, it is made in the USA.  Thank you for making such a beautiful and useful product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It works fine so far and seems to be fairly sturdy. Although, I will have to see how it holds up over time. I'm not sure where this product is made but,  It does have some plastic components to it and if it's made in China, I suspect it may not hold up over time. I will post review updates as this product ages."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Interesting concept, so I bought them.  Frankly, I find I don't eat anything that requires them:  I eat sushi with chopsticks, and never items that are small or medium nuggets served very hot - hot wings or fried fish straight from the pan, for example.  They're not hard to manipulate, but I don't think I'd reorder or offer for guests to use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"VERY cute set.  Looks just like in the pictures.  Came banged up on two of the corners, but this was a gift for a 6 year old with a young brother, so they may do worse damage.  She can fit all of her ""makeup"" and girlie items in the drawer and on top.  She loved it!  Very easy to assemble."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"A very versatile little device, letting you count up or down from seconds to hours.  Several folks at my office use these - eg, spending 15 minutes a day on filing, timing presentations, taking a nap at lunch time (seriously!), etc. I usually put it on buzzer and put it in my pocket - the alarm is a bit loud in the cubicle world."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a large capacity microwave that we bought to replace one that was broken.  It works great, and was easy to set up and learn how to use.  My ONLY nit is that the display bezel hides the top of numbers when you are in front of the machine.  My wife says I'm nuts, but she's six inches shorter than me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I bought this stool three years ago and it is loose and wobbly.  It gets some use, but not over used by any means.  I tighten it weekly now and its just not good.  I would not recommend this stool for that reason.  It fit where I needed it and it looked good, but time to replace it with something else."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I have a nice chair that has the wide wooden legs that allow me to recline and sit. The chair is comfortable and comfortable. The chair is not heavy, it is very comfortable. It is not heavy, it is not heavy. It is very soft. It is very soft."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I am all about two-in-one, and I am very pleased with this product.  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic is sturdy, and it does not slip.  It does not slide around on the floor.  I like the shape of the rubber seal. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,FINALLY. we ha finally found a better way to cook food. This is my go to starter pot. I have had it for a few months and have used it twice a day. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but it cooks evenly and it's not the best pan.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Love it. This replaced a standard suction cup. It's also a very strong one. I bought this for a friend, and she loves it. She is very sensitive to it, and it is a good size for her size. I use it to heat up the stove top."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I use for me and it has kept me cool. I also love that it's been one of my favorite things to use. I love that the ring is not so thin and it's not so heavy. It's a little thin on the bottom but I don't feel like I'm getting a full ring because I'm not
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Seller packed it wonderfully.  We have had it for a few months now and it's been awesome.  The only thing I don't like is that the plastic lid slides off when it's opened.  It's not a big deal for me.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I bought a couple of this set and they look just like the picture, just the same color. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room. It is a good size for her size. I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Weve been using the cheap plastic containers and the wooden ones for a couple of weeks now and they are holding up fine. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now and it is still going strong. I ordered two for my sister and they both love it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"My son has had the same problem and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because he doesn't like the way it looks, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. It is still going strong, I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I'm missing 3 trays from this set, the first one was a gift for my sister and one for my mom.  The second trays are for the daughter who had a very large eye.  I'll be purchasing another set for her.This is a great value. The reviews are great. It is a good"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,We bought three other trash cans to replace a damaged one for our double trash can pullout. None fit right. Finally we tried this one. It's perfect and the company called me personally to tell me they had to ship a second can since ups damaged the first. I received a new can three days after their call.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I just opened the package. They appear to be thick and of good quality. The only downside I can see is that the raised spots on the front are hollow on the back. Which means water, and misc stuff can get stuck in the holes. I'm hoping they won't be difficult to keep clean. I would've given them 5 stars if the raised areas were solid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"These candles are advertised as fitting in the christmas chimes, but the thickness of the candles does not fit in any of the ones we have.  We have two versions of the standard ones, but these candles are not made for them.  The red ones are the right size.  I kep the red ones and returned the white ones and got a refund."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is my first Ceramic stone and ratchet style grinder I have ever had, and I like it. The way you load it is a little bit awkward, but I guess all grinders are. I purchased some Himalayan coarse sea salt with it. This grinder has no problem with it, you can grind it down to powder if you like. I would recommend this to anyone."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Everyone should own a sharpener, It's dangerous to work with dull blades. When I read the reviews, I simply had to have one.
It is very easy to use, Making my home cutlery saver again. We even tried it on the children scissors and it sharpened them as well.

I purchased this knife sharpener for free or a discounted price to use, and to give my unbiased opinion."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are great pans as all the Fat Daddy pans are. I had a bit of difficulty separating them when they arrived. Ended up setting them in boiling water for a couple of minutes till them were hot to the touch then dropping ice cubes in the tip pan till the bottom of the pan was full. With one hot and one cold they separate easily.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,It has been a fine slow cooker so far and looks very nice. I suspect after a couple years it will start breaking down since so much of it is plastic. We have gone through so many that are built like this but the more expensive ones don't seem to be any better in this regard nor do they cook any better based on my experience.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I ordered an entire bamboo set. I also ordered two of these glasses. They arrived at my home and both plastic glasses were cracked. One actually had a hole in the bottome and it did not look like it occurred from shipping. Not worth sending them back but won't buy them again and would not recommend that anyone buy them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Ordered this black faux leather chair for my desk-top computer.  It is wonderful to sit in--comfortable, can adjust to my 5'9"" frame.  I sit for hours sometimes & I don't get back pain or other aches.  Easy to adjust, no popping as someone else mentioned.  My husband put it together in a few minutes without difficulty.  Very happy with this chair."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"What a funny gift! Got this for a friend for Christmas, and he said, ""I don't do nuts,"" to which I replied, ""Neither does she!""  But regardless of where you stand on politics, you have to admit this is a riot. I had hoped to get the Bill corkscrew, but that was twice the price. AND these are collector items, so that is even funnier."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great purchase and we plan to use it for many years to come.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does the job perfectly. I wish it was a bit thicker. The machine works well. I have a portable fan that
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I really liked this chair.  The design is very good and easy to use.  The colors are so bright and vibrant.  I also like the fact that the legs are adjustable so you can adjust the chair in the chair position.  I would recommend this chair.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This rack is gorgeous when it's in the dryer.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the dishwasher is a bit loud, but otherwise, it's a nice quality piece.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.

I love it.  I love the color,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"You know how you think, what do you want?  I'm going to give this to my son.  I had a friend who was going to have a party and it was going to be a great party.  She said it was perfect for her and she was happy.  I love it.  I love the color"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I had hoped that this would be the only one in the world that could be used as a shower curtain.  It is.  I have used it a couple of times and it is still holding up well.  I am a bit disappointed.  This is a very good curtain.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Love this thing! My seven year old granddaughter loves it. I will keep it for a long time.I bought this for a friend, and she is a big fan. She likes it so much, she likes it so much, she sent it to her brother for Christmas. The reviews said it was a great quality, and it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Table top wet grinder is a must have.  The included instructions are helpful for the user and the suction cup is a nice touch.  The basic instruction booklet includes a lot of information to make it easier to follow.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  I love the simplicity and the quick start.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"If I could give this a 5 star rating, I would.  This is a great product.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It does not stay in place. I would not recommend it.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This Grind and Brew makes great coffee; However, it uses more coffee beans than what I'm used to. The only other thing I wish it had come with was a thermal carafe rather than the glass one. If I don't drink the coffee fast enough, then the coffee seems to have a burnt smell to it from sitting on the hot plate too long.

I would recommend this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,So disappointed. I had one of these for 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and it broke as soon as I used it.  The design is flimsy and cheap.  The batteries fell out and the top doesn't stay put.  Night and day from the same make that I had for 10 years.  Must be made in China now.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It looks very nice. I also got the matching headboard and night stand. Needed something inexpensive and this fills the bill. Hopefully they won't all fall apart when the time comes to have to move them. Assembly was only a couple of hours for me. You do have to be smarter than a box of rocks (the dumb rocks, not the regular ones) to put it together."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This item is one of several I purchased from the good grips line. They are pretty easy to clean too. I use mine for some small quantities of baking needs, but am buying the .5 quart version because the squares are not quite what I had in mind as they are very shallow and wide. That is not the fault of the listing, just my visual judgement."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We LOVE these bowls!!!  We needed something that my husband could eat cereal out of, we could use for soup and even cooking in the microwave.  We might buy another set!  They are tall, which helps keep the soup warm in our drafty house!  (low, flat bowls cool down the soup faster).  These are pretty enough to serve from, in my opinion."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a fun and beautiful retro Pyrex set. I collect and regularly use old pieces so these fit right in. The 100 Year Limited Edition set has three measuring cups, three covered bowls, and I pie plate. The paint is all perfect, no misses, no chips. All three of the lids fit perfectly with a nice, tight seal. This is a really cute set, I recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These were perfect for me what we needed them for. There does seem to be very slight height differences but the widths were all the same for me. For the extremely low price they are a good value. They look nice and even when loaded with bath products have held up for me. Could they be nicer? Sure, but at this price point they're a good value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"As other reviewers mentioned, sometimes you have to hit the on button a few times for all the lights to turn on or the off button a few times for them all to turn off.  But I couldn't expect much more for the price.  My son loved turning them on and off in our 4th of July decorations.  Excited to use them for Christmas."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I like the concept and that it has the words in Korean and English, but the execution didn't work well for me. The bags don't stand up without the plastic dividers and it's just not convenient to carry them the way it is set up. I may update my review, but I haven't been able to use this. I wish there was one for glass as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Attractive simple wall clock, runs time on the wall and is easy to read. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The clock is a great addition to my bathroom. It is attractive and I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I use the fan for a number of reasons, and I will admit that I have been using the fan for about a year now, and it is the best fan I have ever used.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"First of all, I purchased this set because the price was right.  This is the first one I've owned.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Awesome!  With this, it is an ideal addition to my kitchen!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic lid keeps it closed and does not slip.  It does not stay in place.  This is an excellent product.  I highly recommend it.

I did not receive"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Instructions for assembly were poor.  I had to re-install it first, and the screw holes were a little too small for the screw heads to get through.  After a couple of uses, it was still going to be a pain to assemble.  This is still a very good machine.  I will continue to order it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"this frame was flimsy and had a little bit of a scratch on it, but I was pretty pleased with it.  The design is solid and is well-made.  I would definitely recommend it.  It will be a perfect gift for my daughters and me.The shape of the mattress is a little off, but it's"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,Works wonderfully so far.  We have had the wooden part of the cup for a couple of years and it seems to be holding up well.  The plastic part is a bit dull and that is a good thing.  The lid is very sturdy.  I use it to heat up the coffee maker.  I love the fact that
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"It is Bosch brand, so it has the quality and design of a Bosch brand. It has a nice yet sturdy finish and the design is very clear.

This is a great fan. It is quiet and easy to operate. The size is perfect and the fan is very quiet. It is very easy to clean and it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These were much better than I thought.  These cards are the ones you pay $5.00 each for at the store.  I love the container as it is hard cardboard and holds up really well.  I already used a card and the recipient wanted to know where I got the cards because they are so pretty.  Will buy again when I'm done with this box.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These forks were just what I've needed to supplement the seafood tools I already had.  I am a lobster lover and will not waste a single morsel of the little claws.  These help me get it all.  In addition, I find these are really helpful for getting olives or pickles out of their jars.  They are great little tools for just a small expense."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was forming on the glass. I had them for quite a while so I didn't return them. Purchased the second set and they did the same thing. I have this pattern in the dishes and wanted plastic glasses because of them being in a motorhome.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've made candy with these several times already; caramel, marshmallow, etc. I have never had a problem with the numbers rubbing/melting/slipping off. The actual thermometer doesn't touch the bottom. I don't need a TON of liquid in my pot for it to make contact (I use 2-3 qt pots). It is very easy to clean (hot water and soft soapy sponge) and I'm very happy with my purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I love that these cutters come in a set but a couple of them are smaller than expected. The baby bottle is small and so is the rattle.  The rubber duckie is also smaller than my other rubber duckie cutter. Not as small as a ""mini"" cutters but not as a large as a standard cutter.  If you are making favors, these are perfectly sized, however."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,...i love OXO good grip products.....i swear...if i didn't have this and my scissors i would starve to death as i can't get things opened without them......this works on all sizes of tops....and really gives you the fulcrum needed to leverage things open even if you are a weakling like me.......bought one for my best friend who has terrible arthritis and it is a great help for he.....
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This product keeps your blades & discs safe and clean when not in use.  I would not have ordered a food processor that did not have this available.  The only con is that the bottom is open - so you have to be careful if you pick up the box.  Just be aware of this and watch young would-be cooks around these kind of appliances.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Was a house warming gift for my nephew and his wife. They LOVE it. They decided to open it and use it right away. The wine really does swirl as it is poured into the decanter aerating it more quickly than your average decanter. I'm so glad they love it and that I chose this as a gift! I will keep this in mind for other prospective gifts!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I'd had a Brita pitcher for about fifteen years and decided to replace it because it was getting a little grimy. I bought this one and the handle broke off within a week. I've just ordered another style which has the handle attached at the bottom as well as the top (like my old one did) and hope to have better luck. I suggest you do the same.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"They work as well as the ones I bought at a local grocery store, and I have them in my bathroom.  The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.  The color is vibrant and the color is a perfect match.  I love the way they look!  I have 2 cats and love the color and the size"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I retired a well functioning, well made, well made, well made, well made, well made.  I had a plastic grocery bag that was the first thing I was looking for.  It was hard to find a grocery bag that had the quality and function that I had been looking for.  I ended up going back to the old"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"When using in an 18x18 window, the wide opening makes it a lot easier to see through the windows.  The polycarbonate design allows the windows to be easily opened and closed without having to flip over or rotate the window in a direction.  This feature is essential for those who want to hang curtains without having to worry about them"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I bought these to hold a bunch of fruit and veggies for my husband who loves to make them. These are great. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This has helped my pizza go from the bottom to the top of the oven. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The pizza is a little thin and it's difficult to get it to cook evenly. I was excited to get this set as it was not the best set I had ever purchased.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These roses are so beautiful, and I love the look. I also love that the yellow is just a little darker.  The green is a bit brighter than the white.  I love that it's a little smaller than the picture, but it's still very beautiful.  The colors are great.  I have a few of them in"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"After a year of my use, I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen, but it's not. The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very fragile. I have had no issues with it, and it is very easy to clean. I would definitely buy again.I love these towels!  They are very"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I just got these bowls and they are just as good as the ones that I got from the manufacturer.  I had to replace a couple of bowls that were broken in the first few months of use.  It was a breeze to clean.  I really like the color and the texture of the bowls.  I will probably buy a second
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I like this clock for keeping an eye on the weather.  I also like the fact that the clock is adjustable.  I am using it for the colder months when it is not necessary to set it to ""clock"" every day.  I would recommend this clock.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old who can"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I was concerned about how secure this would be holding my pots up but it hasn't had a problem yet. It fits perfectly in the small space I have. I can easily access each pan or pot I need without too much of a problem. The couple of hook on the back are a little difficult to get to but I put items there that I hardly use anyway.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Awww I love these! I eat a lot of soup, and hate when my spoon falls into it. :) They work great for cereal too.

I eat at Korean restaurants often, and last year, one of the restaurants gave me one because I told them how much I love their spoons. I used it daily. I finally bought this pack recently, and they are of good quality and decent price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"For me, this pillow wasn't a good fit!  It is an extremely heavy, very dense pillow!  Initially it seemed comfortable enough, but quickly lost its shape!  I have to continually flip it and reshape it.  I was expecting soft memory foam, but it is very firm.  Fabric is nice and it seems very well constructed.  It just isn't the right pillow for me."

We have a small home and no garage.  We ordered this to hold our boat accessories - cover, cushions, etc.  Everything for the boat fit perfectly and we also added patio chair cushions and leaf blower.  We have had this item for two months.  Lots of rain and all items are dry.  We love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I hated this neck pillow! It was so uncomfortable and I couldn't even use it. It's too round and bulky, so your head is too far away from your seat so you have to lean forward. And the opening/curve is so shallow so it fits awkwardly around your neck. I essentially carried this pillow around Japan for 2 weeks just so I could return it when I got home!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"""Leakproof?"" Not hardly! Ever had stewed cheesecake? That's what one of the two of these I purchased and used today for the first time produced. When I unhooked the clasp, water leaked out. and the entire bottom inch of my little cheesecake is soggy. Despite their pricey-ness, these things are made in China. They're going back to Amazon--which, thank you Jeff--stands behind every product they sell. (I'd recommend ditching this one, Jeff."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Purchased this to replace a corning ware casserole dish that broke.  Quick observations.  Heavy and easy to clean.  Do like the look and feel of this.  Now in the market to add some more Le Creuset items.  These are stoneware, breakable, but very tough-they are not the cast iron units, but for baking (now our favorite for rosemary chicken breasts), very tough to beat."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I used this canner for the first time today and was very happy with how easy it was to set up, process and clean.  The temperature gauge on top is really helpful.  Being so inexperienced I don't think I would want to chance it, and not give the canner enough time to do it's job.  I am looking forward to doing much more in the future!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Used the item once. The lid was unbelievably tight, it wouldn't budge. Finally, I pried it off and gave it a go. Completely underwhelming. I used mini ice cubes and the motor was still strained to the point of smoking. Also, there is no way this should be marketed as a travel cup, the blender attachment is in the bottom of the cup and the cup itself is massive."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Yes, I do like this little pitcher, but it is too small.  It doesn't hold a lot of liquid, and I am not sure how the plastic part would hold it up to it's weight.  I would like a bit more space for it to hold up to the heavier stuff.  I have a few sizes, but none"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Easy to assemble. The metal spout is wide enough to fit a lot of shelves. It fits the bottom shelf well. The plastic spout is also very light weight. The spout is easy to clean and holds a lot of storage items. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shelf that holds a lot of shelves.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I bought these for my daughter's wedding.  She loved them.  They are very pretty.  They have the same design as the original but the plastic is a bit thinner and heavier.  I would not recommend these to anyone.I have had this for a few months now and love it.  I love the color, the size,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I really like the rack, it's lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. It would have been nice if I'd used a regular mesh cover to protect the cover from the elements.

The only thing I wish I had known"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I bought this full size and it is the best. I will keep my 2 year old one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this to bring some rice to a table in the living room.  It is very thin and holds a large amount of rice.  It is very easy to clean and holds a large"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Why didn't I buy this one?  It's just too small.  It's been one of my favorite B-sides, and I love the fact that the sides are made of plastic.  It's a good value, and one I would recommend to anyone.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old who can"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I tried to love this, but it didn't work. I tried to turn it off, and the other two worked fine. I am considering getting another one.I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect size for my needs.  I love how easy it is to put together and it's so easy to clean"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"If you read the easy instructions, you know that these are a lot more difficult to get them to do than the hard ones. The instructions also say to put them in a trash can or something and then put them in a large container. I have had mine for two months now and the instructions don't mention how to do it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,This will work for some time. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to clean and holds a lot
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"These votive candles are fine as votive candles; the problem was they were bought because they were supposed to be 12-hour candles. Tried 6 candles and on an average they burned about 3 1/2 hours - a good bit short of 12-hours.  This box of Dynamic Collections Unscented Votive Candles has printed on the label that they are 12-hour candles, so the error is not on the seller's part."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"A very useful and even attractive help to us fun-sized people (i.e., short).  It folds up by just lifting it at the handle shaped opening on top and opens into a step stool when you put it down.  I use this in my bathroom and laundry room to reach stuff on high shelves and I really like it.  Feels sturdy and well made and does not wobble."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"So far (less than a month) it is working fine.  It pretty well matches a new NiCad.  It lasts for one and a half tanks of water.  I am a little disappointed because I was expecting at least enough capacity for two runs before recharging it.  Anyway, it will still be worth it if it lasts at least two or three years.  I'll update then."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Everything went without a hitch with the seller but I just wish this mat was bigger than what it is.  Probably my fault for not paying attention to the size but I hate when I get out of the tub and I stand on it and it doesn't cover all the water dripping off of me on the mat.  Other than that I like how absorbent it is.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I live in Oakland, CA many times it gets chilly, but not cold enough to want to worry with the heater, this is perfect! I turn it on before I go to bed and it warms the covers up from the inside and once it is snuggly warm, I turn it off, get inside and drift off to sleep! I've also slept with it on, but that's not my preference."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The ""polish"" already shows lots of scratches, though I can not tell if it is that or the steel itself.  The thick glass lids are very good, and they actually can match other pans and visa versa.  There's very little problem with food sticking after light use.
Three Stars because there is evidence of being stained from the electric stove, so they are not in fact ""stainless"" as suggested."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"When it comes to warmth and overall quality I'd say its durable and very warm. Would not suggest hot summer/spring nights, it gets way to warm and you find it hard to stay comfortable. It stays together when you wash it. Just when I try to switch sides and roll over I find my clothes sticking to it making it very hard to switch from side to side."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson for Christmas along with the ""Tot Tutors Book Rack, Primary Colors"".  My daughter-in-law loves both of them.  She said the quality is good and they were both easy to put together.  My grandson likes to put his toys away and now has a place to put them where he can find what he wants and get it himself."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"You could make one of these probably for about the same price or much cheaper but really, the magnet makes all the difference. Having this thing on my fridge at all times makes going from stove, to raw ingredients, to the next phase all very easy and with no mucking around with towel drawers or dirtying up handles and everything in my kitchen.
Just one step closer to having things organized"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,Packs alot of power in the microwave and the microwave is a great deal for the price.  The bottom shelf is very sturdy and the attachments are very easy to use.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"not awful, but forget the word. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the burlap out of the bottom of the plastic bag.

It is very easy to store and I can use"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We saw and used these while at a resort in Punta Cana. Everyone was chatting about these mug sets about how odd and beautiful they were. While looking around on Amazon I spotted them and decided to purchase a set for my friend for a Christmas present. It was an easy purchase, fast ship, and perfect pricing. My package arrived in perfect condition and by the way.... my friend loves them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Cool ballon. Nephew wanted a Pokmon theme birthday party but his Mom couldn't find much at local party supplies stores so I decided to surprise them by purchasing this and couple of other Pokmon party items. Kid was over the moon when they received all the packages.

His Mom took it to local party store and had it filled with helium and it actually held up pretty well for about 3 weeks."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't love these, but they are hanging in my house. I didn't look closely at the dimensions of this item, so that's my fault for somehow imagining something larger. This was an impulse buy, and the price was right. I also didn't realize that it wasn't 3 boards attached for each plaque - it's a solid board that has lines painted on them. They look nice on the wall though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This pan has a thick bottom, somewhat thinner sides (but not too thin) and the non-stick coating is excellent. I don't bother to shape the dough much, I just put dollops in each section and they come out more or less scone shaped. Once you get the baking time and temperature right the thick walls ensure that the bottom and sides get enough heat to develop just a hint of crust."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm very happy with the Aeternum pots and pans. Excellent non-stick surface that cleans up easily with just water. I think they work as well as much more expensive pots and pans, so great performance for the price. I bought this one as an addition to the one that came with the set, because it's the most useful size and I decided that I wanted 2 this size for my cooking."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The quality of this tray table/organizier is great.  I wasn't expecting the table to be so solidly constructed and I do expect the table to last for a very long time.  The spring-loaded legs grip the arm of my couch nicely so the table never slips, and the pockets are very convenient.  All of my remote controls fit in the pockets and slide in and out very easily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Okay... let me start by saying that I have never used this apple corer on apples. I used it on potatoes to make a recipe called potatoe bombs (stuffed baked potatoes). This little device worked great in coring the potatoes and I imagine it would do a great job on coring an apple too. My recipe turned out great and this corer worked very well, helping cut down on prep time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Ordered this when the faucet on my Brita Ultra broke. The color doesn't match (wish this came in white as well) but it works very well. There was no smell on this. I still washed it thoroughly before using. It fits Brita Ultra perfectly and actually allows a much more consistent and stronger water flow than the original faucet. Go for this if you need a replacement for your water faucet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We now have two of these, and two of the smaller ones. They're perfect for packing grapes, sandwiches, chips, and crackers. Some of the negative reviews about it not being water-tight seem a little silly as messy things shouldn't be packed for lunches or outings. We use these not only for school lunches, but also when we go to amusement parks, or any outing that will last most of the day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I wasn't sure what to expect. The design is just too thin and the shelves are too small.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This pan is awesome! It holds a huge amount of butter, but it also makes a nice cup of coffee. I had to replace a couple of pieces of plastic pan to get it to work properly. I love the color of the pan, it's a very rich red. The handle is great, it's very easy to lift and hang."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Very cheap, does not fit tightly or properly on the bed, had threads coming off after the initial wash/dry cycle to get rid of the smell. Just feels cheap. Would not recommend. I'm also not convinced it's actually cotton. Feels like polyester. If I had known that I would not have bought it, would not recommend.

It's nice that it's so cheap, but in this case you really get what you pay for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Really cool concept, but it wouldn't cut my veggies all the way because there was a gap between the board and blade. I added a photo and you can clearly see the gap. Maybe I just got a faulty item? Maybe not. Also, in the video reviews I've seen the safety clip as a red piece but the one I received is black all over. Could be a fake. Would not recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great item, I purchased this to add to my collection of heart shaped pans in preparation for Valentine's day. Now I have three different sizes that gives me more options for decorating. This is the standard Wilton pan material but in a heart shaped. It's the smallest size and light weight aluminum material. It is a light color pan, not the dark colored. It will work well for making heart shaped cakes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I just wish the king sizes would be a little bit wider but that is the way they make them.  The picture shows the spread almost touching the floor but my bed is higher so it doesn't come down that far.  Other then that I love it.  It is not very heavy so taking it off at night is easy and not a hassle to take off and on.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I needed a shaker to go with some truffle salt I was giving as a gift. These are great. The top screws off so you don't have to turn it upside down to fill. There are different hole sizes to choose from. Simply turn the whole top. It comes apart for easy cleaning. They come in pairs, so I gave one with the gift and kept one for myself. I love it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"When I went to screw the charges in the first few times, the metal took the skin off my finger. A few days later I noticed both of my pointer fingers had a chunk of skin missing and I'd be bleeding and have no idea why, until the 3rd time it happened and then I figured it out. Very sharp and dangerous. You can see how it can happen in the picture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Ok I say again WHO is writing these reviews. For $89 this is a total rip off. The candle holders are made of pressed aluminum. The stand is Saturday and in 3 screw together pieces. It's painted a fake gold or bronze color. I hope that Amazon puts a stop to these customer reviews that are false and miss leading. Had the price been $29.99 then it would be a great value.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I used it today and it worked wonderfully. I put the unit in the refrigerator in my lunch bag so I could grab and go with morning.  My homemade soup was nice and warm by lunch time.  No more waiting for the microwave, how nice is that.  I'm going to do pasta dishes next.  I'm really glad this is part of my lunch gear.  It works well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and I'm very happy with the results. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Hamilton Beach products are very nice. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It is well made

The only thing I would change is to buy a fresh set.  This one is still very good quality.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a kitchen full of kids."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Overall, I like this product.  I love the look and feel of this pillow.  I just wish the two top sheets were different, but they're the same pillow.  I would definitely recommend this product.Love this. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought this for the room that my cats litter pan is in. The filter that came with the fan worked but I wanted to see if this would do any better. I was very surprised at the difference. Within about a hour the room was the freshest in the house. The room is 12x14 and there is a noticeable difference even in the adjoining rooms. I think even the cat has noticed.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I like to have air circulating in the room while I sleep but don't like it blowing directly on me like my ceiling fan does.  with this I can aim it in any direction and still get the airflow with our it directly blowing on me.  I have had this fan for 2 months now and use it every night, it seems to be well built and is a nice design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I already have a full blown carpet steamer (Hoover brand) that works and that for the most part suits my needs for large carpet areas, but I wanted something less cumbersome for small events/spills/dog puke and such, and for stairs and tighter spaces that the larger cleaner can't easily get to. This fits the bill. It's easy to haul, store, use and clean (and sadly I have had opportunity to use it regularly!)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This hand blender works great.  Easy cleanup and easy storage since the blade portion (and shaft) disconnect from the motor for cleaning.  Having it break down into two pieces allows the blender to be stored easily in a drawer.

The adjustable power levels are great too.  However, I would sure appreciate a ""stay on"" button on the next model.

This blender is great for making those quick Whey Protein and fruit shakes!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Often it is hard to say something nice about products that are supposed to keep you warm.  Well, this is truly an honest product.  Well designed pockets.  It isn't all down filled however the feathers inside do an excellent job.  The cover is quiet and has a lovely sheen.  I feel comfortable recommending Sweet Jojo Designs.  It kept us warm and looks great on our queen bed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased a set of these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them!  They stay cold for an amazing amount of time, and as advertised, don't dilute whatever you put them in.  We use them not only for my husband's cocktails, but also soup and tea for me and the kids and they haven't picked up any flavors at all.  They have more uses than I ever imagined!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"In 2015, they will be charging for each grocery bag used in my area. I had always tried to use reusable bags, but I also found that they'd all be in use for something else when I had to go the grocery store. These are hardy and wash well and they will come in very handy.  Update June 2016: Still use them every time I go shopping. They are holding up well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are great! Super cute. I was always forgetting to not screw the corkscrew all the way into the cork so it didn't have a hole all the way through it. Now I don't have to worry about it. You can see the size of them from my pictures. Also, picture 4 shows me tipping the wine (and there really is wine in that bottle) and nothing drips out, so it definitely works!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Noisy, wobbly, and the lid doesn't seal.  Not worth it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,My package of wooden hangers (not the plastic ones you'd see on my shelves) came with a couple of extra screws and some extra screws to get the hangers to hang. The screws came in handy and were very easy to clean. I was very happy with the quality of the hangers. I will probably order another set soon.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought the Lysol No Touch Kitchen System because I hate touching the soap dispenser when I have yucky things on my hands while I am cooking.
I was happy with the ease of set up. Just click in the soap and turn it on!
The berry soap smell is nice, not overpowering.
My only negative is it took a bit to figure out where to put the sponge/my hand to get the soap to come out."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"It works as a lift but not as I wanted it for which was to be able to place a dish under it and cook in two dishes at once in my pressure cooker. The legs are no where as long as in the image. Not sure if the product was changed from original images, but the legs are not tall at all.

That said, it is sturdy and works so we are keeping it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Only down side... is the rail isn't very tall, but that could be due to the mattress that almost didn't fit. I just put a body pillow by the rail in case he wants to squirm off.
Aside from that, I didn't want a traditional bed taking up unnecessary space. Don't have a lot of money so this was a perfect buy. Came with everything it needed, was easy to assemble. Doesn't look cheap either"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,After reading countless reviews on coasters I choose this set. Many of the other types of coasters had common complaints of a dripping glass or glasses sticking to the coaster surface. Neither appealed to me. This set performs exactly as promised while adding a stylish accent to our newly purchased tables. I'd buy these again without hesitation. The cork backing protects the surface and the thirsty stone absorbs all the sweat from the glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I'm trying to portion down to the real portion size and not my ""Hungry Hombre"" size that I am use to. Three to four onces of meat is about two bites. Diets suck. What I really like is that you can put your food container on the scale, push the zero button and then fill it to the weight you want. No math needed which is good for simple minded people such as myself."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have been seeing the need for one of these in many recipes.  When I saw that it was made in
USA is a plus.  It came in 2 days - faster than I expected.

Update:  I just finished using the damper for pressing cookie dough crust into my springform pan and a pyrex plan.  I was able to get a more even crust bed and not get my hands so gooey."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I will admit is a bit flimsy but that is what some other reviews said. I needed something that I could easily mount on the wall in the room at my father's nursing home so he can hang his baseball caps.  This fits the bill.  It is lightweight which is great because we are restricted as to what we can hang things with.  Now he can keep tract of his hats.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The plates are okay.  We ordered 2 boxes (12 plates total), and both boxes snapped open during shipping, chipping the edge of one plate.  The Black circular imprint is well done, but not quite centered in the plates, and each plate exhibits some 'uniqueness' in shape.  They are fine for our purpose and the price is certainly nice.  Was hoping for more here, but you do get what you pay for."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Looks and Works Well.  I've installed two of these devices now and I like them a lot.  My favorites are the Rev-a-Shelf stainless steel models because they're stronger and clean up nicely.  Installation can be tricky but take your time and you'll get it right on the first try.  I've seen ""pro"" cabinet installers take two or three tries (with two or three sets of holes) so measure twice, drill once."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,I had previously bought the white desk for my daughter and was happy with it. So I decided to order another one for my son. The red one that I received today is ridiculous. The entire thing looks like it's covered in a thin paper. There are faint brown lines on the legs that is peeling away as well as scratches. I'd return it if it wasn't such a hassle. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Same as a big stein I got while in college but plain and cheap. The only glass that weighs enough to hold the water dispenser on my fridge down so I can fill it without holding it myself. My old one has lasted almost 10 years (though it had printed/painted image on it and that scraped off slowly and is now completely gone). I prefer the plain one here, will be fun to etch later."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We received a promo code for this cutting board, but definitely would have paid the regular price.  We were looking for a beautiful board to cut, display, and serve the large cuts of grilled or sous vide beef that we like to prepare for large gatherings.  This is perfect!  We especially like to non-slide silicone feet at the bottom of the board to keep it from moving around during cutting and serving."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Good basic turner - flexible enough (would like it better if more so).  HOWEVER, the edges are sharp - not thin, but with a rough burr from the stamping process used to make the head.  Actually managed to cut myself.  Not a bad cut, but enough to tick me off.  I will need to use some emery paper to try to smooth it down a bit.  Price is right, though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This is beautiful in the kitchen. The only problem is that it's not really a mesh one. It's not very flexible. The mesh is not the most attractive material, but it's definitely not a mesh. It's a thin, thick fabric. This is a great product for the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I do not prefer an ice cube scoop with the handle but it works for me. Very pretty. I bought this for a friend, and she is very happy with it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"IF you need long slender ice for a water bottle or other narrow necked bottle, these will work.  It does take a trick to fill and not get half round ice, or fill it so you have nice round ice and not have water splash out everywhere.  I suggest putting them under a towel so you don't spill any water as you put them in the freezer.  They are well made and durable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Con-Tact paper has come a long way since my early apartment years.  Ths is pretty forgiving stuff - you can always peel it up after you don't get it placed just so. I surprised myself by selecting this bold pattern for older white cabinets. It's actually kind of elegant. I didn't bother matching up the pattern. It really was not possible [for me]. But the seams are not at all noticeable. Great stuff, good price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've never used a chain link scrubber before, but I'm so pleased with how well this cleaned my cast-iron stove-top grill. The links are firm and good quality and it took off grime that a scrub brush couldn't touch. Be aware that the product is very small (smaller than a dollar bill): for my small hands and small grill this was a great fit, but those with larger hands or surfaces may find the size frustrating."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Addendum review.  I love this cart, right size, versatile, sturdy and mobile (have my KitchenAid mixer on top).  However, the hard plastic casters are scarring my oak hardwood floor. I have been online for hours trying to find a better replacement caster = 1/4-20 x 1"" threaded stem with SOFT rubber wheel.  Can not find all specs in one caster.  Frustrated and disappointed. Still looking...

May have found replacement casters.  Hope so."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The glass was busted when I got it. Thankfully I did not need the glass for my project. The frame is good, but a bit on the thin side. I used it to make a jewelry holder for my sister and really needed something thicker. If you are using this, just know that it is more low profile, which is PERFECT for tight spaces. It was super cute painted, but looked really nice before hand/natural too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I had to buy this pepper mill after reading the glowing reviews. There is just one problem with this pepper mill. It does a very poor job of grinding pepper. After grinding for several minutes, only a dusting of pepper is delivered. I have it set on 2 as I prefer a finer grind. My experience is nothing like the reviews. It really makes me wonder if anyone acually used this mill prior to reviewing it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"An amazing rice cooker.  More expensive than most others, but well worth the cost if you use it regularly!  I've used it for rice and steel cut oats.  Hope to experiment with legumes and soups in the future.  Highly recommended!  Also strongly recommend a companion cook book to get the most out of the rice cooker.  Delighted to have purchased this for my kitchen and use it almost every day."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I got a little too excited to use this product with my orchard picked apples so I didn't read the instructions thoroughly and ended up breaking a piece off. I was able to order and replace from the Victorio website. Once I used it properly, it worked great to peel and core my apples. Saves quite a bit of time and was able to make delicious applesauce, pies, and baked apples in no time using this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The price was right for these candles.  I used the proper size votive candle holder for them but only got slightly longer than 8 hours of burn time.  Yes, I did time them.  They do burn odorless and clean and did not flicker at all until the last two hours.  They did burn nearly every drop of wax.  Overall, I was satisfied especially now that I know how long they will last."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are great. Came in handy when  it seemed like our new fridge wasn't cooling properly. Put one on the top shelf and one on the bottom; proved to the repair guy that temps were reaching as warm as 46 (hello, food poisoning) and as low as 28 (hello, slimy, thawed lettuce). Min/max feature is obviously a winner, but the whole design is good - easy to read display, easily switch from F to C... Recommended."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"The furniture was well packed, however the seat if one chair was cracked all the was through on his one side and the top of the table was scratched and the paint on one part was marred. There is no way this happened during shipment. So very disappointed that someone would pack and ship these damaged items. In the plus side I called kid craft and they are shipping our replacement pieces. The furniture does seen solid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Needed hangers in a pinch and this was the best deal I found without going out to a discount retailer where you could pick up the same amount for a couple bucks less, but usually they're a bit more flimsy.

These are surprisingly strong for the cost. Certainly not indestructible but I'm not worried about them breaking anytime soon. They hold my suit pants, some suit jackets, dress shirts, etc. without issue.

Will buy again once I need more."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The concept is great and it really does make the meatloaf better.  I wish the ledges of the top pan were extended so it would be easier to separate the two pans.  It's really tricky when the pan is hot.  If I had known this I probably would have went with a different brand that had this option, but at the time of ordering I didn't realize how much easier it would really be."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I'm very happy with this vacuum.  It is very light weight but yet has great suction.  I like that it automatically adjusts to the floor height -- go from bare floors to carpet easily.  The only disadvantage over my last Dirt Devil is that the hose is not connected.  If you want to use the hose, you have to connect it.  Not a big deal but nicer if it was always connected."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,This is the second one of these I have owned.  This one lasted just a little over a year.  The bottom cracks and it leaks.  I did put it in the dishwasher and really don't want a baking tool that can not be put in the dishwasher.  I thought it said dishwasher safe.  Back to a glass measuring cup for me.  I have owned and used some of those for 30 years.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Fantastic tumbler.  I have used Yeti products and love them.  But love the RTIC products more...same performance at half the cost (or less).  Filled this tumbler about 2/3 of the way with ice cubes and then filled with water yesterday at 1pm.  As of 12:15 this afternoon there was still a good chunk of ice left in the tumbler.  Have not yet tried it for hot liquids, but the cold performance is outstanding."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Was very impressed with the quality. We received it with no missing parts or cracks or breakage. Recommend using a drill to put together it will be faster. My two teens love it and it is very sturdy. After reading reviews I noticed that the white set had more of the issue with cracks and I ordered the black set. I will update to see if any develops, but I cant imagine it happening since its so solid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Beautiful glasses!  I have been using plastic thermal glasses and they always get water in between the walls...and plastic just isn't the same as glass.  These glasses are very nice.  Smooth and thick and do not sweat.  I haven't put them in the dishwasher yet, so we'll see if they hold up.  They are a pricey, but if they hold up are really worth it.  Am going to buy a few more."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This vac works really well, but there is a flaw with the handle in that the unit is not balanced well and tips over breaking the handle.  We have fixed it 3 times already with glue and duct tape.  Those did not work.  Finally, we wrapped the broken handle with Gorilla brand tape and it has held together for many months now.  Love the vac and have used it for a few years, already."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Well made, as you can definitely feel it. The stainless steel feel and the rubber is great.
The cold and heat control maintainenance is great so far.

1 star off for the cap. The lock creates a great seal, BUT it is a pain to get it open. There is no way I can open this while driving with one hand.
I have the older contigo with the press and open. That was much more convenient.

Click help if this review helped."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Really? A tube? Yes really....works great. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put the top on.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It is well made and well
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This works exactly as advertised, and has the same feel. I will keep my old one as a gift.Love it. The plastic is solid and is easy to clean. The color is nice.I had this for a few months, and it's still working fine.  The reviews said it was a great pan, and it's not.  I just put a little water in it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Bought this for my husband and he loves it!  He loves it!  I have one in his bathroom and the other in our office.  The plastic is so soft and it's so soft and it's really good for a bed.  This one is perfect for our needs.  I'm really happy with the purchase.I had to order one of these to use in a
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I hate this vacuum so much. It's just too small. It's been one of my worst experiences with the vacuum, and I have to say, I'm very pleased with it. It's a good value, and it's going to last for years. I love it. I love the fact that I can use the vacuum with a single hand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I had to return the unit because the shipping box was too large.

The vacuum has a self-heating feature. The attachments to the unit are not removable. The vacuum does not have a filter block.

I do not have any complaints about the vacuum. The machine works well. I have used the machine for several years and have not had a single problem.

"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This is a nearly perfect size for the wide variety of containers you will need for the fruit and vegetables.  The container is also a solid stainless steel box with a cover for the fruit and vegetables.  It is attractive and easy to clean.  This container holds a large variety of fruit and vegetables.  I love the color and the size.  It is a solid glass container. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,Pretty useless- ordered 2 of these. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received from the company is the most defective. The box was not filled with enough suction to make it hard to get the lid off. I wish it was a little thicker. The machine works well. I have a 2 year old who can use the lid with a strong enough grip.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I used the Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl when I was laid up in a small hut in Thailand, sick with malaria and scurvy. I mainly used it to vomit in. It never rusted or decomposed. I also used it to cook, boil stream water to drink, and as a hat against the sun. It comes in handy if you are traveling in a less than luxurious country where you need to use everything at your disposal for many uses."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was skeptical of this but it really does work.  I bought the original scent and it's a strong lemon smell.  I was worried it would just mask the smell and my house would smell of poop soaked in lemons.  So glad to be proven wrong.  It passed with flying colors after tests by my husband and grown son.  Living in a one bathroom home definitely has it problems, this solved 85% of them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love these.  Definitely a great purchase.  I keep parrots in my home and burning candles are often toxic to the birds.  I saw candles like these on a recent trip to Costa Rica and was really glad to find them here on Amazon.  They truly look like real burning wax candles.  The added bonus is the timer that turns them on for several hours, and then off again.  I highly recommend these."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This press is great, it has enough weight to do what you need, and is the perfect fit for a 12"" frying pan.  Makes making bacon, sausage, and burgers a snap.  They cook noticeably faster.  The only thing you need to be mindful of is when using for a length of time, the metal edges near the wood handle can get hot, and this is cast iron so it will stay pretty hot.  Highly recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I thought I was buying this to make it easier for me to cook. My hubby was so excited to try it that he's taken it over and I haven't cooked in it once. It's made it even easier than I thought to make dinner! ;-)
It also works really well for crafty things. My daughters and I have used the keep warm feature to make our own lip balm and hard lotion bars, which were really nice Christmas gifts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is an extremely well-made piece of furniture, thoroughly engineered and machined to a high standard.  We put a clear finish on it and assembled it with ease.  What a find!  Thin peg board over the slats does make it flush with the center braces.  We had a 4 X 8 sheet cut to fit at no charge at our local Lowe's, so it fit perfectly.  This is so much easier to clean underneath!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It sets up lopsided so that only one of the little sticks that is supposed to hit the bell is actualy dinging the bell.  The other one always misses unless you give the spin a push and make the little sticks fly out more.  I've tried coaxing/bending it this way or that, since it is oh so thin, but nothing fixes the issue.  Try different manufacturer.  Chinsy crap that didn't work right.  Not recommended."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This bag is built with a sturdy, wide, comfortable fit.  The bag is strong and sturdy.  The bags are also a solid construction and the plastic is sturdy.  The bags are very well made and will last a lifetime.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a bag that holds up to a heavy load.I had to order one of these to use in a different bathroom"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Terrific product.  Sturdy and looks great.  Great quality.  Also, it's been one of my favorite summer drinks.  I love that it's plastic, so it doesn't slip off the counter when I open it.  It also comes with a handy little dispenser for the cold drinks.  I love the fact that I can fill the dispenser with water and"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These are awesome and handy. I love the look and feel of these!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The plastic is a great material and the color is beautiful. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"i haven't even finished opening it yet, but it is pretty sturdy.

The only downside is that it's very small. I think that is the design of the unit.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It holds a lot of food and it is easy"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"As i said, Excellent, does what it should. Not too big or too small. Works great. Great price. Bought 2 and then the first one was a little large but it was well worth the price. Very happy with it. Very happy. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can use it on his bed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Really happy with the Pantone. The quality is good and it fits my Kitchen Aid vacuum perfectly.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It does not stay in place. I would not recommend it.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old who can't move on his feet so I got this for him"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My husband wanted to pick up a high end set of knives but we couldn't afford it so we figured we'd buy it and upgrade later.

So far we've had/used the knives for about 3 months. They are as sharp as the day we bought them, the block their contained in doesn't seem to have dulled them any. They are dishwasher safe, although from time to time we will hand wash them. We never realized we would use the scissors daily."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This knife is bulky and heavy and not in a good way.  The blade on this knife is really thick and the ""sharpened end"" is pretty dull.  I sharpened it myself and it cuts well, but because it is so heavy it is hard to maneuver or get nice thin cuts of anything.  Even sharpened you have to basically pry an onion open to cut it.  This is definitely not a professional knife by any means."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I'm new to sourdough bread baking and new to the world of bread knives. My bread is super crusty on the bottom. Yes the knife is sharp. Yes it cuts very thin slices super straight and easily. However, when I get to the bottom of the slice I do have to saw a bit to get through it. The knife is flexible, and I'm not used to the feel of that, but it does a good job. It arrived quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,It is not twistable after being in the freezer. I always have to put it under tap water for a while before I can twist it. Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 or more containers to fit a normal size bunch of parsley.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a fine cabinet. The wood looks pretty good. The hardware is pretty good. I was just surprised by how much the low-level assembly is needed. I mean, giving me a packet of seeds for Poplar trees, grow the trees, cut them down, and saw the trunk into boards was a little bit too much.  At least IKEA would give you a template for how to saw the trunk into boards, and IKEA includes the chainsaw you need."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Tough and durable. Be sure to look yours over and make sure the enamel isn't chipped or doesn't completely cover everything. Im so happy I purchased this item. It's really heavy but cooks so well and is durable. I would recommend hand washing and only using wood utensils. It takes time to heat up and or cool down. If you overshoot your desired temp it will take time to cool down and this retains heat well. Would definitely purchase again.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I was quite disappointed in this. The picture of the comforter and pillow covers is what I excepted to get.
Instead you get a large cover for your comforter to go into. It is very soft but thin. It is not a comforter as shown in the picture. You also get 2 pillow covers. I also thought I was getting gray and I got all white. I did get this at a reduced rate but I would not purchase this again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,We have been sleeping on this mattress for a long time.  We have a small mattress and we have two small bed covers.  We have used the pillowcase cover for 2 days now and it is still going strong.  We will be sleeping on it for a while and we will be a bit more careful when we leave it on the bed.  I think the mattress will last for a long

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This is a wonderful product.  The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.  If you want to use a larger screwdriver, you'll need to get a larger screwdriver.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,This is the second dispenser that I have bought and it is a nice size for the price. It is so small that it is difficult to use and the plastic lid does not close as easily. It is hard to open if you want to use it as a paper bag. The handle is not strong enough to hold a single scoop of ice or a small amount of ice cube. I will probably just
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,We have the airplane lunch box set and the dinner box set.  These are the best and we will be buying the same set for our family and friends.  I have purchased other bags of food and this is the one I will use.  This bag holds food and is easy to carry.  I have also purchased the orange box set.  They are a little heavier than the other bags but
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Amazingly effective.  The rubber attachment acts like a curry brush and picks up a ton of fur from furniture.  The suction is great for a vacuum of this size.  The cord is very long so vacuuming large pieces of furniture and even carpets is convenient.  It is easy to empty and clean.  One star detracted because as other reviewers have noted, the placement of the vents does cause debris/fur to fly everywhere if you're not careful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"First of all these bowls are beautiful. Shiny, sturdy stainless steel. Couldn't ask for more. To start with, the price is right .... I bought them for my bread making needs and they do the job. They are made in India and anything made out of stainless steel in India is usually good. I definitely recommend them. They will last a long time and as per my experience will not rust or deteriorate.
Would give them more stars if they were available."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Hard anodized cookware makes cooking enjoyable again!  The dutch oven evenly heats on my electric range, while living up to its non-stick performance promise.  You can slow cook a pot of chili in it all day and know its not going to burn or stick.  The slender handles are nice.  I've always hated thick, bulky handles that don't resist heat well.  I haven't had any heat problems so far.  I'm well pleased with my purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Bought Chico bags and another variety (which looks like stuffed fruit when rolled up). Chico's material is thicker and more durable. It's easier to get products in and out of the Chico bags, and they hold a surprising amount of groceries an other items. Their compact design makes them easy to stash and have them around when you need them, in your pockets or vehicles. Easy to wash them, too. No more cheap ones for me. Also like the color variety."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protector. Guess I use the sheets to substitute for that.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,One banana and a hand full of fruit makes a big serving and is yummy and filling. Really don't feel deprived that I'm not eating ice cream instead. Really love that clean up is super fast and easy. It is winter here and we have to let the fruit thaw for 30 minutes. Easy to get the hang of it to see when it's thawed to where it is not rock hard but still semi solid.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I had high hopes for this set. I was looking for something a little less scary than stainless, and have heard some good things. After one use on the stovetop the bottom of the pan on the outside began to wear off and became sticky. I sent back ASAP. Not sure if I got a faulty pan but I didn't want to take any chances. Received a full refund and purchased a SS set and will never go back. Good luck."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I have gotten up every morning to go to bed. I slept on my side in the morning. I don't know if I am crazy, but I am not a great sleeper.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I was very weary from using it and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money. It does take up a lot of space and it is not very large. The size is perfect and is perfect for the kitchen. It is a great size for the most part.I have had this for a month and love it! It has held
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"This is a really terrible product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the suction to run smoothly. The suction is so great, it's impossible to get it to be fixed without a vacuum. If I had to replace it, I would have given it 4 stars instead of 5. I had to order a second one to replace the first one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I use these a lot and have had no issues. I will keep them for a long time.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I bought these for my 18 month old and they are ok.  I much prefer the infant ones as they are a little easier for her to hold and the support stick inside the popsicle is a little long on these and she gags on it.  It would probably be good for older kids or adults.  I also don't love the tray.  The popsicles have to sit on the tray in the freezer which is a bit precarious.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"This stopper does not work at all. My plumber had to change out my drain to run and he put in a pop up. The previous one I had picked up all of our hair and it worked well so I knew how much hair comes off our heads in just a few days. With this catcher, it might catch 4-5 hair stands in a few days. And while showering I end up standing in 2 inches of water."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I read all the reviews of this item. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about buying them. I just made Low Carb Pumpkin Bread in my new large bread pan. It turned out awesome and removing it from the pan was very easy. I didn't grease the pan in any way. These pans are not flimsy, definitely non-stick and stacking them is not an issue because they bend in whatever direction you need them to. I'm very happy."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Oh my gosh!! This is even cuter than pictured! It's just the right size for me, but some people might think it's a bit on the small side. I use it for cat treats, which are small, so it fits quite a lot. Though if you buy it to put people cookies in, I doubt it would hold a whole box or package of them...more like half the package would probably fit. I still think it's a great addition to any kitchen."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Update: this pillow is the best Ive ever had. It is like no other pregnancy pillow. This will help you fall asleep in an instant. We keep the room freezing cold so the pillow case doesnt stick to me and it feels silky. I cannot sleep without this pillow. I wish I had bought it for my first pregnancy too.

Old: This pillow has been amazing so far. Day two of me having it and I'm
Actually able to get a full nights sleep."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,I ordered this pie pan to make smaller pies for just one or two people because I felt the six inch was a little too small. I like the size it works well with refrigerated pie crust. When using canned filling I like to drain off some of the liquid before filling so the pie has more fruit and the filling fits well in the pan. I have washed mine by hand only and dried immediately and had no rust issues yet.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great product! It is the perfect size for me to put in some carrots and some ranch dressing for a late afternoon snack. The included ice pack is a little difficult to remove the first few times, but it's only a minor inconvenience. All in all, I love this little container. Some mornings I will even take oatmeal in it instead for breakfast when I get to work - it's the perfect size! I would definitely recommend to all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,There is not one thing that has kept me from using this.  I have a large one.  I have had it for a couple of months now and it works great.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would hold a lot more.  I also love the fact that it is portable and it can be used for a variety of things.  I have had it for about
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I have this cutting boards' and it's the best. I also love that it's removable and doesn't move around the dishwasher, which is great!I bought this to put in my oven.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"The quilt set is nice and thick and the fabric is thick enough to make it comfortable to hold.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The TubShroom really works!  It seems to catch every strand of hair.  It's slightly unpleasant clearing the hair from the TubShroom, but I wait until it's dry and use a piece of TP to clean it off and it's no big deal.  I liked it so much I bought one for my son and his family.  If they like it as much as I do I'll buy another one for them. I have one in both of my bathrooms."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups. The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"There are a LOT of pieces to this dresser. Many, many more than I expected. Most are poorly labelled. I spent 6 hours working on this thing and the drawers don't line up, so I can't close my top drawers.

I am so disappointed. I have spent so much time trying to put this together. I will have to get someone to drill new hole to lower the rails for the top row. I can't believe after all of this that it doesn't work!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm no professional, but I do enjoy wine. I decided to splurge on some fancy wine glasses and after browsing around, decided on these. They're a bit taller than they appear in the picture, and much nicer. As others have said, wine really does taste better with these glasses. They're beautiful and classy looking glasses, though they do feel very delicate. I'm always very cautious when washing them. I've had them for a couple of years now though, and they've held up well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Good product for value. I washed it in our (newer GE model) top load washing machine with agitator in cold water. I was a little confused when it said wash at 140 F - like was it required that I washed it at that temp? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was confused. I washed it in cold water and it was completely fine. I also dried on the low heat setting in our dryer and it was completely fine as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,We decided we use our toaster daily so why not try one that might cost a bit more but had great reviews. Our other toaster was a name brand- Cuisinart- but never toasted evenly and consistently. The first toast out of the Breville BTA830XL was toasted perfectly on both sides on all four pieces! The fact it can also toast long pieces is a plus when toasting a slice out of a large round loaf. Best one I have had in my lifetime!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We have been using this for about a month, and are really satisfied. I was looking for a solid navy rug for my sons room and the price could not be beat. The navy isn't too dark, so it does look like a true navy and matches nicely with other decor. Im not sure Id put this in a high traffic area, but it works well for a bedroom. It had a new carpet smell for a few days, but it quickly went away."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I love how you can cut them to fit whatever size wire you are bundling.  I have an external USB port on my desk and the bundles of wire are varying in size.  These worked great.  I also was able to cut a nice small length for my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength more than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The side fabric is soft and pretty, thicker and better than the cheaper plain white vinyl models.
The compartments are way too big for my wine glasses tho.
This would work well for balloon wine glasses or any large and wide stem, but it is much too big for smaller european-size white wine stems.
The dividing cardboard is loose and floppy. Unless you fill up each compartment, it will flex/collapse and allow your glasses to bang together.
I ended up using the container for wide mouth beer glasses."

You can see more of the stand n my review of the above mentioned unit.

It looks great, as a matter of fact, it looks like it's actually PART of the Nespresso machine. The drawer slides out with ease. Very happy with this purchase, and I think you will be as well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Nice looking and effective microwave for the $110 I paid.  I was worried about buying a cheap microwave and checked a number of options in the $100 range.  I am very pleased with my choice.  I've only had it for 6 weeks but I have used it for potatoes, oatmeal, defrosting, steamed vegetable bags, frozen fruit and milk warming.  Works like a charm and it is intuitive.  I glanced at the instructions and got the hang of it quickly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I have other utensils in aqua sky that are made by KitchenAid. I have found all of them to be of very good quality. This one is longer than I expected but I believe I will be able to utilize it in my kitchen. Due to the thickness of the spatula Edge I don't think it would be very good for turning fried eggs but many other items could be turned with ease. For the price tag of $5.25 it is an exceptional value.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"LOVE IT!  The vent is a little wide, but I will keep that in mind when ordering. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,Very slick looking scale. The handle has a wide opening and is smooth. The handle slides smoothly and is easy to clean. The plastic handle is also very light and easy to wash. The metal handle is well made and will last a long time. I would recommend this scale. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can use it on his bed. She loves it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Solid coffee maker and I use it everyday.  I've also used it for a few hours.  The top is a nice, solid stainless steel, and the inside is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the coffee is very hot.  I love the fact that the stainless steel is very thin, and it's very easy to clean with a paper towel.  I just put the coffee in the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"People beware!  First off, this is NOT an oil stove.  It is a small, inexpensive, and extremely small, dishwasher safe pan.  The plastic lid on the handle is made of metal and it is not waterproof.  The pan is not made to last.  The only way to put it together is to leave it in the dishwasher and put a paper towel in it to dry it. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great shower curtain. Does not go over the shower curtain. I will not recommend it.Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, and she is very happy with it. She has been using it everyday and she loves it.I was excited to get this for my niece's wedding.  She loves it!  I did have to make sure the lid was on the top of the container when she opened it,"

I have used them twice and they still look like they will last.I bought this to replace a broken machine I bought 2 years ago. I did not want to be the one to break the machine. I wanted to get a new"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This dish drying rack is great for a small apartment like mine. When I don't need it, I fold it up and it slides in under the sink easily next to my trash can. When I do need it, it can hold many plates and cups and even a pan or two. Cutting boards for as well. I got this because I had one a few years ago that I lost in my move. It was an easy choice to get this same one again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,Too much trouble putting up this film.  Followed Instructions but still could not take out the bubbles and wrinkles.  Worked on it over and over and still not so great.  The film would block the heat and sun okay but the trouble of putting it up and trying to make it look half way decent was not worth the trouble.  I need to find something else for my storm door and windows because of the frustration of putting up the film.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've never bought a silk plant that looks real.  Though this one looks OK after you fiddle with the adjustable branches for around 10 minutes.  You can't just plop in the corner ""as is"" .... if you want it to look somewhat realistic, it does require some primping, which is no big deal.  This fits the bill for the bare spot in my TV room.  I placed it in an antique crock with peat moss and am happy with the results."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my Capresso  frother! It's become a favorite little noise in the morning. While my coffee brews, my milk or cashew nut or almond milk happily swirls away into a nice hot froth. Nice and compact, so does not take up a lot of counter space. Whole milk froths better than 2% or non fat. Unsweetened almond milk does not froth, needs to be the sweetened kind and it will get a nice head of frother. UNsweetened cashew milk WILL froth a little."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"If you pay attention to the type and cut of the blade. If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade. Also, given that garden tools have heavier tougher blades, this tool does sometimes loosen up during rigorous sharpening. I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit before using this sharpener. But, for the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These are nice little Infusers. The holes are a little small but if you don't overfill the container, the tea is able to steep better. One thing that is confusing is why the photo shows 4 when there are only two per order. Still, the craftsmanship is nice and they are user friendly without making a big mess. I have one at home and one in the office and love the ability to have a cup of my favorite loose tea now without a hassle."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"WE LOVE THIS Calendar! I use it everyday and it is a great addition to my kitchen!

I have had the same bed for over a year now and it looks great in my living room. I have been in a hotel room for about two weeks and it still looks good. I love it. I have a bed frame and I can't wait to put it up!I use this to make homemade coffee and it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Didn't but it here but, it has the quality and design of a lot of other products.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the sides are adjustable so it doesn't look like a fixed size.  I wish it was a bit thicker but I would love it if it was a bit heavier.  I have a hard time getting the ball into the hole when I push it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"For a small sized and small size, the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very large. The material is not absorbent, which makes it very difficult to clean. The material is not strong enough to break the seal of the lid, but the lid is very strong and the lid is very easy to remove."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I wanted healthier cookware and this set is the best. I will be purchasing more!Very pretty. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It looks good in her bed. I would recommend to anyone. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his feet so I got this for him."

It is a good value.I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"" for 2 people at a time.  I can use it on my counter top and it will make my pumpkin smoothie without"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Apparently, from the reviews and images posted for this product, not everyone is receiving the same product.  I received two ""Crucial Vacuum"" branded filters when I ordered this item (Bissell HEPA Media Filter, 32076).

As noted in the review of the Crucial filters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bissell-Style-7-Style-9-HEPA-Media-Filter-Compare-to-Bissell-Part-32076/dp/B003C0FH0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bissell Style 7, Style 9 HEPA Media Filter; Compare to Bissell Part#32076</a>, these filters are notably short (~1.8mm).  Numerically, this may seem like a small difference in tolerances, but it allows a significant amount of air leakage through these gaps."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I actually really like the look of it and when closing it it appears to create a pretty airtight fit.
Two things come across as a bit misleading though;

a) There is in no way a vacuum created or maintained, and
b) I can not see how it will allow for gases to escape.

Apart from that it's a neat looking container that appears to create a airtight space for my coffee beans.
Will use it for some time now to see how it makes my beans smell and taste :)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The colors of medtainers are really great, the green is bright and cheerful, your eye gets drawn to it. I also have a blue one which can be harder to find but it's a very calming bright blue. They are solid and contain smell pretty decently. The grinder works pretty well too. The pictures make them seem a little bigger than they actually are, they are a little bigger than an rx pill bottle. Plenty of storage but still compact and convenient, very good size imo."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"After searching my local furniture stores for a TV stand and coming up empty handed I came across this one several times online. I decided to try it out and it was worth it. We thought there would be some press-wood somewhere in the mix but we didn't see any. It was as the description said: ""Made of poplar hardwood solids and cherry veneer"" which was shocking. Overall we were pretty happy with the purchase and the price even though it was a piece together unit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"As many other reviewers have said, one of the corners did not inflate all the way. It is still compressed to 6"" on that side. The rest of the mattress did end up being about 11"" tall. I waited a full 72 hours before even sitting on the mattress. This mattress collects and generates an incredible amount of heat. I will wake up sweaty directly where my body is touching it. Overall the firmness is fine and it is comfortable. But is defective and too hot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I absolutely love these sheets.  They are well worth the little extra price for this quality.  I have purchased 500 thread count sheets before that you can almost see through after a few washings.  These are soft and thick and luxurious.  They have quickly become my favorite sheet set.  I haven't found a negative yet and hopefully will not.  They are now out of stock but am waiting for more to come in so I can purchase a second set.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I am giving this one a 4 because the finish is good and easy to clean. I just wish the two top screws were a little tighter. The plastic is a little thin, but that is not a problem. I would definitely buy this one again if I had to. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style for him to use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I bought this pillow because it was the only one I could find. It's been one of my favorite pillow covers ever. I also bought the Tumbler version, which is just as well. It's a little bit bigger than the one I got from Amazon, but I like it so much I will keep buying it. I'm very happy with this pillow. I would buy it again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This was purchased and used for an overnight stay at a hotel in Hawaii, and I was surprised to find that the bed is very comfortable. The pillow is a nice plush material, but it's not comfortable. The bed is very thick, but I don't feel like I'm getting a full bed with a pillow. I'd be very happy with a pillow if it were a bit more plush."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Most silicone potholders are too small to be used as a pressure cooker.

The handle has a suction cup that is very flexible.  The handle is not flexible at all.  If you are using it in a pressure cooker, it is going to be a little bit of a pain to put it on.  If you are using it in a pressure cooker, you will need to use a more firm handle"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,Its ok. I say good luck. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on.  The plastic part is also hard to put on.  I would definitely recommend this product.Love it. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a new one.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We have a couple of ISI whip cream chargers.  In the past, we have mainly used the ISI cartridges.  We decided to try the Purist cartridges because of the big price discount.  Based on about 15 cartridges used so far, we've had perfection operation.  The ISI cartridges were sometimes difficult to puncture, requiring pliers and a protective wrap to tighten the cap enough to penetrate the cartridge.  So far, all the Purist cartridges have penetrated easily and have fully charged the dispensers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Sloppy fit between the jug and the electric motor, necessating having to hold on to the whole thing with both hands when I turned it on. Poor seal between the Jar and the cap caused a spillage mess. No variable rheostat so I couldn't start slowly and avoid a jump of the liquid in the jar. I believe the next time I go to the rifle range I'll take this thing with me so I can have the satisfaction of killing it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"When the bags arrived I thought there was a mistake! The bags looked so small! After I opened them, I still thought they were not going to fit anything! To my delight, they are huge and exactly what I needed! I'm storing bed sheets, fitted and flat (I have dogs so I have many sheets for the couch!) in one and clothing in the other! You don't realize how deep they are until you zip & start packing! They both easily fit under the bed! Very happy!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So easy to put together! If I can do it anyone can! I like this shelf because you can build it as high or low as you want it. I couldn't build it all the way up because of my cabinets above it but I just used the rest of the materials and built another two tier shelf for my son's closet. So far so good.
I have three kids plus my husband so we have shoes galore! This will definitely help keep our shoes neat and organized!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We bought these to replace the more stylish set we bought from a different manufacturer shortly after we got married.  These are far more durable and best of all they are not so big that they can't fit in the dish washer.  Corelle has made plates from this material for years and I expect these to last as long as my parents' and my inlaws' sets of Corelle have.  They may not be the most trendy design, but they do the job very well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Want to reach the last little bit that's waaaay down at the bottom of that jar?  This Norpro Silicone Jar/Icing Spatula does just that; cleanly scrapes up remaining morsels even in narrow jars because of its slim size. As far as icing is concerned; haven't had an easier time of frosting cakes or cupcakes since purchasing this product; smooth application, manoeuverable, fits right down into the hole of angel food cakes!  Great for smoothing the frosting, creating peaks and swirls."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"The lids are a little tight on the bottom, which is a nice bonus. I like the extra space so I can open the lid before I get the first drink. The lids are a bit small, so I have to use a size for the glass to fit. The lids are a bit too small to hang on the wall, but the lids are so light-weight and comfortable that I can't imagine hanging them"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"It is wonderful, it holds a lot and the finish is good.  I have a large one and a small one.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I first saw this on Amazon. I thought it was a little cheaper than the ones I had. It's not. The plastic is solid and is easy to clean. The only thing that I didn't like is that the lid is on the bottom. This is a problem for me. I have to place my hand on it and push the plastic right on to the top of the lid. I have had to use a little force to
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I love these. The openings are a little wide, but I'm happy with my purchase.  The bottom is not very deep.

I didn't realize how much space it would hold until I put it in there."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I don't now about the rest of you, but it certainly seems like a drawer full of clothes, kitchen towels, socks, underwear, etc. takes on its own odor after a time. This little bags take that smell out within about a week! Amazing and successful. I prefer using natural unscented products for cleaning, bathing, laundry, etc., and these little gems definitely fill the bill for destroying annoying odors. Another plus with these are they can be ""recharged"" just by placing them in the sun for the prescribed time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was looking for less expensive cookware than what NuWave had to offer and this was a great buy. Very reasonably priced. I do use the Barkeeps friend to handwash, not the dishwasher. I believe if you properly take care of your cookware it will simply last longer. Look really nice, exactly what I wanted. I did do some digging thru the other buyers complaints and some were exaggerated. The others were very helpful as far as care instruction. I recommend if you looking for induction ready cookware."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had all kinds of sheets - marginal and top of the line. These are my favorite yummy sheets. I'm using them in August and they are no hotter than a set of 600 thread count sateen sheets. They don't pill, they fit my 14"" mattress well (not sure if they'd fit anything bigger than 16""), all the stitching and hems are perfect.  They are really affordable given how expensive sheets are these days (especially kings). I'm buying more. Wish they had more colors - rose perhaps."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It does make some good french fries, but it does not seem to provide the same heat for frying that requires a higher heat, as your stove. It gets to a max of 375F and takes about 8 minutes. Appreciate that the product has a magnetic cord for safety. As a tip, don't dump frozen fries directly into this fryer to avoid splatter. I throw it in the air fryer to dry out the moisture for 5-6 minutes and then deep fry it, and it comes out well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Seems like such a small little bathroom gadget couldn't bring so much joy but you would be wrong. Nothing worse than a bar of soap all gunky in the shower. I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it! The only thing I worry about is possibly bumping into it and breaking it, maybe in the future design they should consider a little suction cup on the base."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm in love! I wanted a set of these, and I'm so happy I got them! They look so nice and are very sturdy.  The colors are great.  I love that they are made in China.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I received it today and started using it right away. Its easy to use and it comes with labels. You don't have to use the labels they have made up. You can write out your own on the cards that they give you. I love this. Its just the right size that you can place this in the top part of a shopping cart and take this with you where ever you go. I glad that I got this and I will order more and give them as gifts.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,It's very comfortable. I'm always hot so I do have to turn it once in awhile during the night. It's just me....when I do move it just a little it's nice and cool. I've not had any neck issues since it arrived and I slept on it the first time. I can hardly wait to go to bed and put my head on it at night. I would suggest that if you have an issue with any pillow you are using you might want to give this a try.

I tried baking a pizza the very next day, setting the timer as usual , but it didn't go off. It made the ticking sound but didn't ring when the time was up. Low and behold, another burnt pizza, because I was waiting for my timer to go off. So disappointing, because it was a really cute timer. I returned it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It didn't juice very well, after just one apple the mesh cutter on the inside got filled with apple and didn't juice until I cleaned it out.  And not to mention it didn't get a whole lot of juice out anyway what i did get was an apple shake. Seemed like a hassle to have to juice something then take it apart and clean it just to continue. N by the time I finished cleaning it out the juice that I did get looked awful and tasted awful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Received this item in early March.  Tried it out on a particularly filthy (ground-in dirt) section of carpet - results were so-so.  Recently used it to clean upholstery (wing-back chair + chair and matching sofa set) stained with years of oil heat fumes, tobacco smoke and mildew.  Wow!  Not perfect, but a real improvement - this old furniture is presentable.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"The three gallon size is perfect for the wide variety of containers you will need for the fruit and vegetables.  The container is also a bit small for the size of the containers you will use it for.  It will be a perfect size for the size of your food.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"These are pretty nice sheets.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I also like the fact that they do not have the embroidery on the sides that you would normally find in other sheets.  I would definitely recommend these sheets.I use this as a ""pumpkin grater"" for my family's Christmas dinner.  It is great for storing fruit and veggies.  I love the fact that it has a ""frozen"""
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I wasn't sure about this, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large kitchen.

The little print on the cover is very nice. I really like it.

It is a bit difficult to read the color, but the print is on the inside of the cover. I just put it on the countertop and it reads"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Great product, good quality. Just what I wanted.We love this blanket.  It's warm and fluffy.  The blanket is very soft.  The blanket is a nice white color and is comfortable.  It's not heavy so it will be a long time before it sheds.  I love it.  I love the color and the fact that it's soft and plush.  I love the fact that it's not a blanket that"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I absolutely love this inexpensive, functional, and very comfortable pillow. I have a large one and a small one. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it for several years and have had no problems with it. I have had no problems with it falling over or anything."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Fit the RV Queen well...nice tight fit.  Would have thought the product would have been a bit thicker, in that the photos make it appear to be similar to terrycloth.  Having said that, it is not too thin and so far is not noisy like some waterproof mattress covers.  I did not rate it a full five stars because a) we haven't had a waterproof test yet (no grandchildren overnighting in the RV yet) and it is new, so value over time has yet to be determined."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is very pretty and looks extremely real.  For the price, you can't beat this item.  It's actually a bit larger than I thought it might be, which is a good thing from my perspective.  It took a bit longer to get to me but that may have been due to weather issues.  Don't hesitate to get this.  My entire home is Oriental motif and this fits in beautifully...and no worries about trying to keep a real bonsai alive, which can be quite a challenge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought mine at Kohls because I had Kohls cash and they were giving 25% off.  I absolutely love this.  Its perfect for me and when I have grandchildren over.  Frozen fries, chicken, fish sticks, jalapeo  poppers, etc. come out so crunchy.  Getting ready to get some salmon, etc. and make healthier meals and see how it turns out.  I did purchase some accessories from Amazon but haven't tried them yet so I cant review them yet.  So far I totally love this."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,This silicone cake pan makes a great presentation. I made a chocolate cake and it turned out great. I have reviewed other silicone bakeware products for Amazon and have been happy with them. Clean up is super easy because almost no crumbs or residue from the cake remain in the pan. The cake did pop right out without it sticking to the inside. The instructions do say to bake with the pan placed on top of a cookie sheet. Great for a party as a way to showcase a cake.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I had been searching for one of these locally for awhile. Finally picked one up here on Amazon. I am not sure how I lived without one before. I have not had a single boil over with this. It does rattle in the pot. In my case I like the rattle as I can tell if the water is boiling. It washes up really easily in the sink. It's a little bit of a pain to fish it out of whatever you are cooking. Even so, it's worth the effort."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I  always have a throw covering my couch cushions because my dog sleeps there when I  am at work. However, it not only has to protect, it also has to look nice. This one does both admirably. The cotton fabric will protect, it is very soft, and I  LOVE the stripes!  Add in that it is machine wash & dry, and also very competitively priced, and this was a deal I could not pass up. (By the way, he loes it, too."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I am wheelchair bound. I use a wheelchair and it is a pain to turn it around.  I have two small hands and I am constantly going to have to use the wheel.  The wheel is a little smaller than I like, but it works.  I am happy with the quality of the product.

I did get a free item for review.I've had this for about a year now and I love it!  The color"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"So beautiful in every way. I love the look. My husband likes it too. It is so colorful. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise. This fan is great. The reviews said it was a great fan, but it is not. It is a cheap fan that has a noise level. It does not have a fan noise."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I placed order when this was on sale.  I was expecting a lot of the same stuff.  I am very happy with the product and am happy with the price.  This is a very well made and attractive set.  The size is perfect and is perfect for my needs.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a kitchen full of pots and pans.I love this! I have had it for a few months and it is doing
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have had it a few weeks and it's just what I wanted.  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic is a bit rough and rough to put together and the wood is a bit rough.  This one is a bit cheaper than the other one.  I love the color and the wood is very well made.  I also like the shape of the handles and the fact that the metal is smooth
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was looking for something that would be lightweight and comfortable for a travel mug, but I just wanted a cup that wouldn't get hot.  The basic design of this mug is pretty straight forward, and it's a good size for a standard mug.  The handle is very comfortable, and it's easy to clean.  I'm very happy with it.  It has a very nice shape, and the handle seems to hold up quite well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loves it! He has really limited counter space, but needed a place for his K-cups so I looked into all of the different options. I debated getting him a freestanding holder that spins, but again, he has really limited counter space. Since he already has his Keurig on his counter, I figured I would get him something to go beneath it that wouldn't eat up any additional counter space. This was perfect and it's still going strong a year later."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought our Bosch mixer in 1970 and own most of the attachments that are available for it. This is an industrial grade product; it's indestructible. The criticism that it will not work well for small batches is totally wrong. I've been using it, on a regular basis, to make single loaves of bread for 40 years. This is an idea that has been spread by people who own a Kitchen Aid mixer. It is just not true! And all the attachments including the blender, food processor, juicer, grinder work beautifully."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've packed these into a suitcase on a cruise ship and hid in my pockets at a F1 race with no problems.  I easily fit a fifth of liquor into two of these.  I don't particularly like the graphics advertising, but don't think it will show up on an x-ray.  If security sees the pouch they will know what it is without the markings anyway.  The small spout makes them difficult to fill and even harder to dry out, the smell of liquor inside doesn't go away."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have been looking for something reasonably sized, can sit on a counter, stackable, and won't break the bank for my potatoes and onions.  These little plastic bins are perfect for what I wanted. They are white plastic, not the prettiest things, but they function very well. There are little pull out tabs on the bottom for stacking. They hold an entire bag of onions with room for shallots and garlic heads. They hold a 5 lb bag of potatoes

For my needs this is exactly what I was looking for."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Bottom line? They do the job, look nice and for little out of pocket and I'd buy em again. Recommended.

I have a decent system, certainly not high end. I just upgraded from my all-in-one handmedowns to some Polk bookshelves and needed some flat stands. Easy to build (25 mins) and they do the trick. Nothing fancy. Would buy again. Some folks complaining about cracked wood. Just don't use power tools or over tighten. And yes, the cord system is a bit of a joke. But easy to hack if you're concerned."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Beautiful hanger, but more than that it's an elegant design.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not a huge deal. I wish it was a bit bigger.

I gave it 4 stars because the color is a bit lighter than the picture. It has a dull, very pinkish-brownish-brownish-"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Seems to be high quality.  I love the look.  My husband likes it too.  It is so small.  I am considering getting another one.  I have no idea what it is made of.  I am not sure about the quality of this product.  I would not recommend it to others.  I will update if I find something to add to this review.I just bought this to use in a hamper. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Meh, I wasn't impressed with this set, as the instructions are a little misleading, but I'm glad I didn't. The plastic parts are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now, and it's been working great.  The reviews are always a bit misleading because I've had it for about a year now.  It has held up well, but I don't think I'll ever use"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I have used it 10x10 and it does the job. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a bit small but the plastic part does a great job of blocking out the light. If you're thinking about buying one for yourself or someone else, I suggest looking at a larger one. I'm sure you will love it. These are great. I just wish they came in a different color."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Love it! Last a couple of weeks and the finish is good.  I just wish the one in the picture was a little bigger, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size to hold the glasses.  I just put them on top of each other and they are perfect"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I actually bought this to use with small jar candles rather than tarts. It works perfectly for me and I love the pretty green color. I cannot have an open flame in my office, so this is an excellent substitute. It heats the small candle thoroughly, does not take up lot of room, and is easy to use. The cord could be longer, but this is not a deal breaker. I love the product itself and am very happy I decided to get it. My office smells wonderful all the time now!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My business partner, who had a perfectly serviceable Mr. Coffee drip brewer recently replaced Mr. C with this sculpted, whirring contraption.  He is so enchanted with the machine and so proud of himself for buying it, that he put the machine in the center of his Etruscan marble-top kitchen table.  He and I start each business day in his kitchen having a cup of coffee.  Maybe my taste palette is dead from years of Mr. C. coffee, but coffee from this new machine tastes EXACTLY like the old stuff."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Starting with the packaging...it was perfectly packaged and instructions  to unpack it as well. Then the product itself is one of the most amazing mattresses I have come across. Ultra comfortable with a nice protective zipper cover on the outside. If I was not going to use it for my sofa bed I would have put it on top of my current mattress just for the comfort. No smell to it whatsoever. A quality product at a very affordable price. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good mattress.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"When my last really good pepper mill bit the dust I decided to buy TWO replacements.  One lives on the dining table and the other lives on the kitchen counter.  Why?  Because only one good pepper mill would always be in the wrong location!  The adjustable grind is great, it grinds the pepper corns without resisting my efforts and the mills look good in both the kitchen and dining room.  What more can I ask for?  Oh, and they came pre-loaded with whole black pepper corns!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"No, I am not paid by Pyrex, but I do think their glassware is wonderful. That could be due to the fact I spent 15 years reusing Chinese food containers and infomercial Tupperware, so perhaps the bar was set low, but I have used this 14 piece set at least seventy times and have had no breaks in the glass despite a couple of drops. I have also ran them through the dishwasher dozens of times without a single problem. Recommended to anyone who is tired of using old cheap storage containers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I was tired of constantly hearing the suction of these containers.  These were the perfect solution.  I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have used this product several times in the past, and it works great.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the color, the size, the capacity, the size of the lid, the size of the handle, the size of the containers, and the"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"It's not the rather large, bulky suction cups you'd expect from a single-brand one. It's not the dishwasher safe.  The suction cups are a bit large for the purpose of washing them.  I would prefer one for the dishwasher.  The suction cups are a bit smaller than the ones I have had in the past.  I like the size of the suction cups, but I think that they will be a"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This is the best. We have had the best of them all. They are strong and sturdy. They are dishwasher safe. The dishwasher is a breeze. We just have to keep them in the dishwasher for a few days and see if they break. We have used them for a few weeks and they are still working great. We like the size and shape of the bowls and they are pretty strong.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This set of ""pliers,"" perfectly sized for the wide variety of knives that I need. I have one in my kitchen and the other in my office. The knives are great.

I would buy again.I have a few of these on my"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This is suppose to be a standard size pillowcase. It is not, it's a full sized pillowcase.  The pillowcase is also designed to be a cover for a large pillow. It is made of a stiff material, which is not as soft as some of the other products I have seen.

I did get a matching pillowcase for my son's bed. I love the fact that it has a nice, sleek design, and it is"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I ordered these for my son's school lunches, and they've worked perfectly for trail mix and small snacks. I have to run between several locations for work, so I also keep one in my bag that is filled with almonds in case I need a snack on the run. It has saved me from vending machine runs several times so far. They are easy to clean, and I haven't had any spills. I love that they are so brightly colored, too. It makes it easy to find in the bottom of my bag."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Came fast I think I ordered it early in the week and it was here by the end. I ordered mine with the 100g weight for recalibration. I feel for the price I paid this thing is great and with the test/recalibration weight even better I also like how it has all the instruction right on the lid. I have owned others and the where about the same, I've used it from everything from rocks, herb, mail, and anything else I might have needed it for. What I was looking for the money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Put me down as another person receiving a defective unit. First, the machine never cooled past -7F on ""pre-cool"". Second, on the first and second batches (I didn't make any more), after the ""add mix-ins"" alert and mix-ins are added (not many, and not large pieces), the machine sounds like a motorcycle revving in the kitchen non-stop and the paddle stops turning. The ice cream was alternating between ""frozen yogurt"" and ""gelato"" on the display, actually reversing back down a couple of times. I'm trying one more time before buying a different brand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I really wantes to like these...and was excited for meal prep. I received the package quickly HOWEVER I am extremely disappointed. I paid $17.95 after reading reviews saying these were sturdy containers...one of mine came broken. Keep in mind there are six, I have not used them..I took them out and washed them with lukewarm water and soap and got to the last bottom container and it was BROKEN. This is ridiculous for having paid so much money. ..I was better off with the cheaper kind for 8 bucks. I want a replacement!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great product, easy to apply. The nice thing about this design is that you can use it horizontal or vertical. We wanted to cover a window that was about 60 inches wide and 30 inches tall. Didn't think it would look good if we had to use more than one piece. Most privacy screens that were the right size had a design that could only be used vertically and were max of 36 inches wide, so wouldn't work for us. Finding a privacy screen (other than plain etched) that works horizontally was awesome."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Nice idea, but the plastic doesn't stick to the walls of the cupboard. I'm not sure how well it holds up. The cups are designed to be tall enough to hold up to regular cups. It's not clear how long they hold up. I don't know how long the rubber seal will last, but I'm guessing I'll be able to use the same ones for a while. It works! I love the color and the design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,We bought this for my daughter's wedding. It is a little bigger than my previous one and we have two small dogs and I am worried that she may be allergic to it.I have had this for about 6 months now and it works great. I love it!The shape is perfect and it's great for holding the pillows in place. I didn't realize how much more room I had until I put it on the pillow and it was perfect! It's
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Makes excellent waffles. I found this to be the best. I will keep my waffles warm and toasty. Great buy!Works great. The ring is a nice feature. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It is easy to clean and has a very nice shape. I would not buy again. Great.

It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is heavy and a little
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,These take up the entire room. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of things. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is very fragile.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This exactly as advertised. I received mine in good shape, though it was a little bit bigger than I imagined.  It works perfectly, and arrived  without dings, scratches or plastic anywhere in the product. I did put some boos butcher block cream on it since it's going to be exposed on my counter.  It's a nice product for a good price.  The company also contacted me via email to make sure I was happy with it, with assurances that they will fix it if I'm not. I appreciated the followup."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a nice looking cabinet. I put my home theater console, printer and DVD on the shelves. The bottom drawer is more spacious than it appears. It wasn't too hard to put together and the finish looks like it'll hold up. I replaced a 6 ft entertainment center with this (gave away the big tube TV and VHS tapes). Now my room looks a lot bigger. This would be nice anywhere you need some storage in a small space. The back is closed but there are holes to punch out for power cords."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was very nervous about ordering a rug online because this is a purchase I would normally want to see and feel before buying.  But when I requested that Lowe's bind a 9x12 area rug and they said it would cost $1,000 (even though the rug itself was only $300), I decided I needed to shop around.  This large rug was only $360 and it is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!  The color is perfect; it's soft and deep; it's really perfect!!  I would recommend highly to anyone.  You won't be disappointed!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a wonderful item. I was having issues with my mattress  and box spring and decided I needed additional protection for my box spring so I purchased this product. So far there is a big difference now when I lay down to get some rest. The pests ( mites, or other pests) are not bothering me. I also treated my box spring with small amounts of pesticide to add additional protection. I recommend this product, it has lifted a tremendous burden off my shoulders and allowed me to sleep well at nights."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Two hams (1 12lb, 1 10lb) sliced up with ease. Does prime rib in short order with consistent pieces. Its great to slice up top sirloin and eye of round roasts. Briskets are a breeze with this knife. The handle is very comfortable. And you can get the last of the mayo out of the bottom of the jar when using the knife to make sandwiches. Personally I have no need for the 12 size so this works perfectly. Just steel it after every use and it will stay sharp quite a long time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased these China storage containers for my son's third-grade science class. I was excited to find these in the box. The containers are clear, and the cover is very sturdy. I have had no issues with the lid sticking out. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a way to store their own electronics and toys. I had to order one of these to use in my kitchen. It works well and seems to last for quite a while."

The attachments are small, but the cover is strong and thick. It is great for packing a large container of coffee. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that had a broken seal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This gets a 5 star because it is lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I don't like the material.  I prefer the more polyester color, which is a good thing.

I also like the shape of the cover, which is nice for putting on the shower curtain. "

NO CORD TO PLUG IN.  BATTERY LIFE IS ADEQUATE FOR OUR SMALL JOB CLEANING, AS I BOUGHT A SPARE.  I GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE THE DUST BIN OCASIONALY FALLS OUT,  IT DOESN'T SPILL, JUST FALLS OUT.  A DESIGN ERROR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED BY NOW.  IT IS VERY EASY TO EMPTY."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I bought this set to mainly use for my lunches.  I prepare my lunches for the week ahead of time and these are perfect for that.  I can also use them for additional food storage in the fridge or pantry if I need to. I have bought many different sets of plastic containers recently trying to find ones that would work for me and also be easy to open and close.  These seem to do the trick and so far I am very happy with them.  Love the orange color too!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

Is still a great stool, just not safe non slip.... it is super sturdy and easy to use, just stay dry"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have kitchen towels with and without hanging tabs, so I needed a good clip to hang them on.  I looked at some previous reviews that said that the towels slipped through the gap with this item, but I haven't found that to be a problem at all.  Maybe my towels are more hefty than the other reviewers.

The adhesive is absoutely solid, no slipping even when I've had water spashover from the sink above.  They look great and they hold my kitchen towels perfectly.  I've had them now for several months."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We were having trouble cooking anything on our new cooktop. I am still not thrilled with the fridgidaire Professional cooktop (see different review) but we ordered new pans to see if that would help. These Ceramica pans are awesome. heating is very quick and the heat is even. no need to heat higher than med on the gas burners. We get great browning, no burning and the non-stick capability is superb.

I highly recommend these pans. I have, 8"", 10"", 12'"" fry pan, the 11"" deep skillet and square grill pan and they are all great."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I love love love this little pitcher. It is thick and easy to use. It is a very small pitcher and I am not sure how well it holds up to the large amount of water it takes to get the water out. I would recommend this pitcher. Great for the price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,i bought this for my mom for christmas. she loves chihuahuas so i thought she would like this. when she opened it she had a big smile on her face. she loved it. she named her chloe. why she would name a salt and pepper shake is beyond me but it made her really happy. she has it sitting on the kitchen table and she uses it all the time. she wants me to look for a boy one now maybe one day i will get around to look for another one that is a boy
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought two of these. They installed in a flash and look pretty much like the promo shots -- as though the books were floating in midair. The bottom book in the stack needs to be a good-sized hardcover (but not too big or else it sags). You can put anything you like on top of that. Once there, the books are not as conveniently accessed as on a normal bookshelf (and the bottom book is pretty much off-limits entirely).

As long as you are aware of these limitations before you buy, I think you'll be pleased."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Like most uprights it is better on carpet than bare floors.  The suction is excellent and the unit and its attachments are well made.  It is very heavy when compared to canisters which makes it a little inconvenient to use in certain places, such as stairs. The other two drawbacks are clearance under cabinets and furniture are limited due to the large nose. Secondly, I find it necessary to buy OEM bags spending more than I anticipated.  The copies either are sized  wrong or missing a rubber seal and therefore decrease suction."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a great little snack box. I use it to take veggies or fruit with us when we know it's going to be a long day. It's sturdy and small and easy to slip into a backpack or my handbag. It is also easy to wash up and it's adorable.

However, the reason for one star off is the fact it is called a lunch box. There is no way I'd be able to fit my child's lunch in it. And there isn't room for a drink so I prefer to call it a snack box."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I really like this electric kettle.  It's comfortable and it's easy to clean.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the kettle is made of ceramic.  It's not cheap, but it is better than most electric kettle.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I've received no compensation for my honest and unbiased review.This is an outstanding product. I have two of these around"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I have a Rowenta that looks a little bit more like a Queen bed, but I like the extra size so I can fit it in my bedroom. The pillow is a great size and the color is beautiful. It does not stay on the bed for long and is a great size for the price.I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent.  I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain.  I have a hard time cleaning"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"We own 3 other Funtainers and have had no issues. I will keep my Funtainers and the other two Funtainers.These are perfect for the price, and great quality. We bought 2 of these and they are so perfect for our car. I use them to heat up the stove top. I have a large freezer and I can use the microwave to heat up the top. I just put the stove top on the stove and use it as an oven to heat"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"It's a good size for what it is. It is thick enough to hold a small amount of coffee. If you want a nice, solid coffee mug, you'll be disappointed.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of coffee. It is very easy to clean and holds a lot of liquid. I've had it for about a year now and I love the way it holds up. I will buy another one"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I love this desk. It has the quality and design of a professional desk. It has a nice look and the color is bright. The colors are true to the picture and the color is vibrant. It is a perfect size for my needs and I am happy with the quality of it. I highly recommend it. I had to order one to replace the one I had for my grandson. I love the color and the size.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a large high-quality stone. The base is well designed. Two rubber gaskets come with the stone to keep it in place when in use. Knife sharpening is not something I do everyday so I have not yet used this with a variety of blades. However, it seems to be everything that I want or need to keep my good carbon and stainless blades maintained and sharpened. If you have an investment in good knives it makes sense to invest in a fine stone that will not damage them. I am very pleased with this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have to say I was Leary on purchasing these,but I'm so glad I did! Each one has a plastic piece you pull out when your ready to use,so you don't have to worry about them not working when you receive them. I did a test to see if they stay lit for a long period of time. 7 days they were lit! I am using these in Chinese lanterns for my upcoming wedding reception I used 4 lights in each lantern and attached with fishing line and wow I am amazed at how bright these are!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This is a neck support system that at first feels a little stiff. But that is temporary condition as it responds to your body heat to relax to a form fitting neck support. My wife loves it now where as originally she was not impressed now she loves it. I am buying another for my self. I tried it also and found surprisingly good. You must give this a little time to shape to your neck with out becoming so soft as to give little to no support.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I'm glad these were cheap or I would have been royally mad.  First of all, the material these sheets are made off is horrible.  They are slippery so my son wakes up every morning with the comforter on the floor and the sheets almost off the bed.
Also, the picture is very deceiving.  The sheets are black, and the only colorful thing is the pillow.  My son is 7...I'm not sure black sheets are what he wanted.
I bought my other son a set of Batman sheets at Wal-mart which were cheaper and better quality."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased the sugar and creamer set as a Christmas gift. When I took it out of the box to make sure it was in good shape, I fell in love with it. I love the off white color and the subtle design. It elevates the plain white sugar and creamer bowl to something beautiful. Now, I have to talk myself into wrapping it instead of keeping it for myself. Seller provided very quick shipping. It arrived 6 days ahead of schedule. It was packaged well and protected with extra packing. I'm very happy with this purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I purchased this blanket to go with my summer coat. I will be purchasing a second one for my other two summer coats. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a vacuum. I have had this fan for almost 3 months and it is working just fine. I also have had the fan for several years and it still works great. It does not have a fan noise and it does not have a vacuum.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I bought this set three years ago and they look just like the picture, just the same color.

I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Quite easy to assemble and looks great in the kitchen. I will keep my shelves in order and use them for extra storage. I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it for several years and have had no problems with it. I have had no problems with it. I am very happy with this purchase.This is a great product
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Nice machine, I think.  We have had it for a few months now and it's been working great.  The blades are nice, but they're not as sharp as the ones we have.  We'll see how long it lasts.I have had this for a few months now and love it.  I love the color, the size, the quality.  It has great storage for my bags, and I love the fact that it is so easy to clean. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I cannot say enough about this set.  It is a great product for the price.  It is so easy to use.  I have used the Tumbler for several weeks now and it is still going strong.  I will be buying another one for my daughter.  I love it.  I love the color and the size.  It is a great quality.  I just wish there was a way to go by the size.  It is very easy to clean
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Taylor's of Harrogate Yorkshire tea was my favorite tea when living in the UK & Ireland - now that we are living in the US I am delighted to be able to get this high quality tea delivered to my door for such an affordable price!
This is a large 160 bag box of tea, the tea itself is smooth & full bodied with an excellent flavor. The teabags can be used for hot tea or also make an ideal iced tea.
I totally would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys a strong full bodied black tea - delicious."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"This is very good product at an exceptional price.  The thing that bothers me though is that it often seems to fry the foods at the ridges instead of grill.  In turn, there is an appearance of grilling but a fried texture.  This may be due to the width of the ridges and the non-stick coating.  However, I think this is common to all makes of these pans.  Face it, nothing beats a true grill.  Nice to have this when it is raining or just too cold to fire up the BBQ."

Fabulous for those high wall spaces in a cathedral ceiling kitchen! I put mine above the cabinets and displayed a  faux vintage birdcage with QVC timed candle pillars inside, with a couple of other items to one side way below the clock. Looks awesome!  So much nicer than plates, baskets etc that are so passe and well, boring;) Can't go wrong with black for an accent, and the orange red of the poppies really pops on that huge wall. Great packing and 2 day ship."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have had mine for Two Years now. I have had no problems. I believe the company states 3-4 second response time.?.....Mine seems to work much faster than that.
I mostly use mine for photography. Chemicals for Color Photography are rather critical...not as much with Black and White...but the more consistent the better. I have had mine in my darkroom for a bit over two years now, it has worked fine. I have checked it against my Kodak Thermometer, and some rather expensive Industrial/Scientific thermometers, and this thing is pretty close. For 25 bux, it is a good deal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this for almost two years and it's still running on the original batteries (and they're cheapies).
It's kept the time and date perfectly.
Update: 11/20/17
I noticed the display was a little dim.
I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.
I got a little under 3 years from a set of cheap Sunbeam AA batteries.
One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.
The clock is still accurate in time and date so I'd call this a great purchase."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"was shorter than expected, it looks more like an inch. I will keep my review for the full length.  Great buy!Works great.  The ring is a nice white color and the color is a little darker than the picture.  I wish it was a bit thicker.  I love it.  I love the color and the size.  It is a little heavier than I expected.  I would not buy again.Great.  I like that the very first time I"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I like a firm supportive grip. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to slide.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back, so it was perfect for her. She has two sons, and she was looking for a chair to go with her. She loved it. I've had it for about a year now and I love the way it moves. I like that it's so easy to store"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"Makes brewing coffee simple.  We have had the recipe for two weeks now and have been using it.  The cup is a nice, solid stainless steel, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint is that the lid is a little loose.  Otherwise it works very well.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a glass-bottomed coffee maker.I love this! It has a nice handle and seems sturdy. The color is very vibrant and very realistic."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"This is a fine thermos, but it is a very thin one.  If you have a thermos that is too thick, you will need to get a better one.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Really easy installation, but design is a little tricky to put together.  There is a hinge that is a little too short to fit, but that is okay.  It is very sturdy and it is well made.  The carpet is very soft and it is very firm.  The machine works well.  I love the fact that I can use the auto-wash feature.  I have had this machine for over a year and am very pleased with it.This is a great product"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have older versions of the Contigo Autoseal cups, and wanted to pickup a couple extras.  These are the same great quality as they've always been.  However, this one has a bonus, the closure in the top is on a hinge that comes almost all the way out, so you can clean it SO much easier!!  I've alwasy loved these cups, but hated cleaning them because there were so many little spaces I couldn't quite clean as I would've liked.  This new feature completely eliminates that problem.  I'll definitely be purchasing more of these!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was looking for a small, oblong shaped gold laced edge doily for my kitchen table. The table seats four and this size fits perfectly. I wanted a piece much shorter than a table runner. I placed a small centerpiece on it and I got the dimensional look I was hoping to achieve. The fabric and lace looks much better than I had hoped.  It is not flimsy. Haven't washed it yet, but I feel it will require a light pressing which is okay. Package arrived early and well packaged. Glad I purchased it. Exactly what I needed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I bought it because the stainless steel would hold far fewer bacteria than a plastic turkey baster. However, this doesn't hold suction well.  Liquid (wine in this case) doesn't just drip out... It RUNS out.  I am able to work around it by quickly tilting it back to retain some liquid.  I wanted to try to avoid using a glass thief as it would probably be broken by my clumsiness. I see there are plastic thiefs out.  Guess I will just have to get one and replace them from time to time to avoid contaminants."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,This is a good thermometer.  I wish it were faster but I honestly haven't found one that was fast.  The probe it came with frayed after about a year.  The replacement probe is thinner and coated so it makes smaller holes and is fray-resistant.  As with any thermometer calibrating is a must.  Mine was off 3 degrees on the high side.  Ice water should be 32F and boiling water 212F.  Hold the CAL button for 5 seconds then use the arrow buttons to say how many degrees you want to adjust it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love this thing. I have had it for six months now and it makes doing laundry so much easier. It is attractive, made of quality materials, and the bags are just the right size for a complete load without overstuffing the washer. The basket rolls easily, is sturdy, and I appreciate the rubber end caps on the hooks of the bags that hold them on the rails. Also the bags are a material that does not take up odors or dirt easily, when stinky laundry is removed from the basket to be washed the smell doesn't stick around."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"We did a ton of research on the pros and cons of this product before buying this one. The pros are that the dishwasher is easy to clean, and the cons are that it's difficult to clean when it's full.  The cons are that it doesn't stay in place with no maintenance.  I've washed it with soap and water and it's still soapy.  I just put it in the dishwasher and it still looks great.  I would recommend this product for anyone"

The suction cup does take a little getting used to, but it works well enough.  The suction cup is still very good for the price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Do not believe the ""highlights"" - these are the roughest pillow cases I have ever had.  Plus, they are no larger than the ""regular' ones that come with sheet sets.  I bought them based on the reviews and that they were supposed to be larger and soft...they are neither.

I am a little shocked because the reviews were so good.  Do keep in mind I am highly sensitive and perhaps a ""normal"" person would think these are soft...but size...I laid them out on top of the other pillow cases I own and there is no difference at all."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"First:  This is really solid hard wood, no veneers or crap wood.  Second: It was very well packaged and shipped with NO damage.  Third:  All parts were present & easy to assemble.  Really folks,  if a 65 year old woman can put it together,  you will have no problems.  Allen wrench included, so you do not have to hunt for tools.  It is nice and sturdy and looks very nice.

This table is only 32 inches wide and with leaf is 54 inches deep.  It is perfect for a small kitchen."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Much paler than the photo and different shade.  Very light and more grey, I'd call it pale lavender.  Also it's 100% polyester.  If you read the package CAREFULLY it does IMPLY same quality as Egyptian cotton and lower states microfiber, doesn't exactly come out and say polyester.  Misleading product information.  They're ok for what I paid but I would have preferred that the product information clearly stated what it is.  Also wrinkles.  After initial laundering, original shipping wrinkles present as well as new ones from washing.  I removed from the dryer promptly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This matcha green tea whisk comes with a beautiful ceramic holder to keep the whisk in perfect condition. I chose a teal blue, which was so pretty! The whisk is made of bamboo. Using the whisk helps powdered matcha tea get the perfect consistency with no lumps or thick areas. This set is a high quality and in my 2 weeks of using, it looks as beautiful as it did when I opened my package. I hope to add some photos later. I did get a discount to try this out, but it in no way guaranteed a positive review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I ordered one of these curious about the comparison to the Honeywell product.  If you haven't noticed (by reading the reviews) this is not the same product that Honeywell delivers with their air filtration unit.

The filter that came with my unit was a bit stiffer in construction when compared to this replacement filter but, I'm fairly confident that this replacement will provide similar performance.  It is identically sized, and seems to have the same filtration capabilities (or darn close) to the actual Honeywell product.

I'll order this again, and feel confident in suggesting that you give it a chance."

I just put the lid on and the lid is on and it is a perfect size for soup."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"What more can you ask?  The thermometer is accurate, my oven isn't.  I cook a lot better when I know what temp my ever fluctuating oven is.  This is easy to read, and it hangs off the oven rack so it doesn't get in the way.

I have Prime, so it arrived quickly.  When I purchased this it was even less expensive than comparable thermometers at my local store.  I like this one because the dial is larger and easier to see.

After several months it is still running strong.

I hope my review has been helpful for you."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This product is the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. We have to empty it and do laundry about once a week between the two of us. It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge. I used a couple of command hooks to hold my bag up, but it's not an ideal solution."

So at present, unless they send me one that doesn't sound like I turned on a leaf blower and has a blade that has a higher rpm, I'm getting my money back. I hope it is just a defective machine, because the rest of it is fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This bacon cooking product is much more efficient than a previous, different style of bacon/microwave cooker. It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon."

Dang.

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one. Removing the old cylinder just took one good whack, then installing this one was easy, everything fit nicely.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Oh well.

I will try again with a different manufacturer. I will modify this review if it turns out that it's somehow the chair's fault, rather than the piston's fault."

We got this canvas art (and the Ninja one) to decorate our 4 year old son's room (he wanted to get all the baby decorations out and dress it up in more adult/toddler style). So, when I asked him what he wanted he said cars and ninja. DONE!!! He turns the lights on by himself before he goes to sleep and gets fascinated every time. The colors are vibrant and the product is really well done. Great concept, good quality, and the room looks much better and brighter as a result. Very happy with this wall art."

It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it, because it is so wide.  It is very easy to fill"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"After owning this pot for a couple of years now, I have used it for about a week. It's not the best quality, but it is the best I've ever used. The pot is well made and the handles are perfect for hanging. I love the way the handles are designed and the way the pot handles the water. I can't wait to try out the new pot. I just wish there was a way to hold the water longer. I will buy another one for my friends."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Finally some decent kid sized cups. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall person. She's been using it for about 6 months. I am very pleased.I bought this for my husband for his party.  He's a huge fan of the ""durable"" plastic containers that you can use for any kind of beverage.  I am very happy with this one.  I love that it's made of solid wood"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I cook a lot and this is the one I choose.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small but the plastic lid does hold it together well. It is still very sturdy and I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I wanted something that would last a long time and so I got this one.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It lasted a year until I discovered the flow of water or the bump's pressure just gave up, it was still under warranty so the local store from the De'Longhi's list of local service providers took it in and fixed it at no charge, then a repairman on my way out told me that with this machine I should make sure the coffee grounds are fine and not pressed too hard or the machine starts to lose it's power to push hot water through it. It's been a good investment so far, the water is plenty hot & the shots have beautiful crema."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've slept on my Coop Home Goods memory foam pillow a couple of weeks now and I love it.  You really can contour the foam for higher or lower loft, just as advertised.  The pillow cradles your head for perfect comfort.  Fifteen minutes tumbling in the dryer at low heat restores the original shape and loft.  Coop has followed up twice since my purchase with tips on use and offers to correct any problem, but I have none.  Compared to other top line pillows, this one is top quality and value priced.  I would definitely purchase again!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Attractive 100% cotton duvet cover with shams that is reasonably priced but still has good quality. It's easy to find cheap sheets or good sheets, but getting to the perfect middle is difficult sometimes. I like the subtle design on the set, subdued but not invisible, and the feel of the cotton is very smooth, not scratchy or too tightly woven (it gets very hot here in the desert and high thread count sheets don't breathe as well as the lower count). It's still too hot to use the cover with a duvet, but it serves as a nice top sheet for now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Original review: 5 stars.
Current review: 2 stars.
I bought a Gotham along with this one and tried them simultaneously. The Gotham was a disaster, everything stuck to it and cooked unevenly. This Copper Chef has been fantastic! It even cooks better WITHOUT oil!!! I haven't cooked much but the little I have has been wonderful. It is still new and I will update as I use it more. So far so good.

UPDATE: I rushed leaving my review... As I said, it had worked wonderfully until... I kept using it.  Now EVERYTHING sticks to it.  Disappointed and I apologize for the misleading review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"This brush fits Miele vacuum cleaner and the brush is comfortable. The brush is strong and doesn't move. I am using it for the first time to take care of my pet hair. It is in good shape, and it is going to stay that way. I am very happy with this product and will be purchasing more of it. I highly recommend this product. Love these! Easy to use and easy to clean!Love this very nice quality."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I love mixing bowls with this set and the combo is very easy to use. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The bowls are great to take with me to work and I love the color. I am very pleased with the quality of the bowls. The bowls are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full bowl into a bowl. I will probably purchase another set if I need one.I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,Bought this as a supplemental pillow.  It's comfortable but it's also a little hard to put together.  I've had a couple of people have had it in the past and it hasn't had any issues.  I'm very pleased with it and will purchase it again.  I'm looking forward to using it for other things.I ordered this to add to my tea collection.  It works well and seems to last for quite a while.  I bought this for my son to use on his

I have a lot of bathroom decor and this one is perfect for that.  I have a sink that"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,At first glance the esthetics of these pans are impressive.  However my use of the smaller frying pan twice left me with a yellowing pan.  I have purchased much cheaper pans that did not change once used for. Cooking.  Surely the manufacturer understood that these pans would be used at high temps etc and the appearance should not change after two uses.  Also the instructions said to wash before use and oil. I did so with canola oil and it is struck on the sides.  Also the food that I cooked stuck to the pan during the first use.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This DII Halloween Skeleton table runner looks really cool. I am using in the classroom when we study the human skeleton system or during Halloween week. However it came wrinkled, so I need to iron it prior to use and will likely hang it up a wall or in front of a book shelve. Also, I prefer that the tablecloths have a polyester blend to it so that they do not shrink in the dryer or wrinkle so easily and apparent. This is slightly see through and has only one stitching, so don't expect to last long, at-least wash it in the gentle cycle."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I really like this shower rod.  It is sturdy and the brushed stainless finish is attractive.  The instructions said to fit the rod in the opening, then to remove it and extend the rod one more inch before tightening to lock it.  I did this but found that the rod was too loose in the opening.  I just took it out again, turned it to unlock it, extended it another inch, turned it again to lock it, and installed it.  It is rock solid now!  I have several InterDesign products and find all of them of good quality."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Bought these to stage my house before selling.  They're great -- you do have to assemble - but it was simple.  My husband did one and our bored neighbor kid did the other - he was 12.  He had it assembled in less than 10 min.  Bought 2 for accent.  The chair fabric is textured -- it's not ""smooth"" -- but it's comfy -- it's a good height that I could pull it up to my dining table --  the fabric color is a light, light cream with a chocolate brown markings.

I think they are from Ashley Furniture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"These vases are awesome. They have the design and look of a nice, beautiful, and expensive. The top is a nice, solid, clear plastic, and the sides are made of a solid material. The bottom is a bit of a thin plastic, but it's not a problem. The only problem I have with them is that the lid is a little loose. I just put the lid on the bottom of the machine, and it's still very firmly closed."

It does not have a coffee cup holder. This is a great product for the price.I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent.  I also use them to cover my nails and to keep my nails on my feet.  They are so soft and absorbent that I don"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Arrived right on time, and looks great. It is a little heavy for my small kitchen, but is so sturdy that it will be easy to get around if you don't have it sitting upright. It is a good value for the price. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my daughter's wedding party."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"Very nice kitchen tool, Seems to be well made and functional.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The blades are not sharp enough to cut through the fabric. This is a problem for most kitchen tools.

The only thing I will say about this knife is that the blades are very sharp and very comfortable. I have not used it for slicing, but it is well worth the price.

I would highly recommend"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I wanted to love this set, I really did. It looked great the minute I put it out of the bag and onto my bed. However, after the first round through the washing machine (they do get dirty you know). it lost its shape and it no longer was the comforter that I wanted on my bed for it wouldn't lay flat. It had places where the batting would be bunched up and places where it would just be the outer material. It looked cheap and I ended up giving it to my dogs to lay on in the garage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This mattress protector is great to protect my sons mattress from potential accidents. It doesn't add any more comfort to the mattress, but it certainly isn't uncomfortable. It fits his mattress nicely and doesn't budge during the night.

The stitching is nice and it is made well. I've washed it a few times, and it didn't fray or shrink in the wash.

It does what it is suppose to do and what I expected from it.

I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but all opinions are 100% my own. I did not receive compensation or payment in any way."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This was a good idea unfortunately it is made with cheap metal, the shelves all bend in the center under the weight of the lightest pasta box. Forget about being able to store anything like cans or jars, not gonna happen. I would also like to add that DBRoth company has the worst business sense ever. The seller did not respond to my request to return till it was too late, then I was told they would grant me a partial refund so I sent the item back at my expense and it's been over three months later and I have not received a refund."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Update Nov. 10.2015: This thing sucks, totally inaccurate. I started measuring against known weights (thanks metric system) and it is wildly unreliable. Adding small measures of water to a container does not show up consistently, so you will see a jump every 50-100 grams while slowly adding something. Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.

I like the style and apparent built quality, the glass top makes it very easy the clean in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, it is wildly inaccurate at the gram-scale, and unreliable at ounce-scale, and only useful for lbs/kgs. I am past the return period and will be chucking it to buy another brand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"These are very cute stools, and I am very pleased with them.

The only downside is that the top is a bit of a mess, but you can't take it off without it sticking.  It will be fine, though.

Overall, I am very pleased with these.  I have a few of them in the kitchen and they are a great addition to any kitchen.  I would definitely buy again.Great.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,I was very excited to find this item.  I was expecting a lot of the other one.  I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to clean and holds a lot of liquid. I've had it for about a year now and I love the fact that it is easy to clean. I have had it for about a month now and the color
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Great holder,  only issue is it doesn't stay in place after a few uses. If you have two hands, it's a bit difficult to hold the lid on it. The only thing I wish it were a little more compact is the size. I would have preferred the rubber seal to the lid, but it's not the problem. I think the design is perfect for my purposes. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is a great product for the price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I bought this with a few other people as a Christmas gift.  These work well and look great.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.  I am a bit disappointed.I bought this to replace a broken machine I bought 2 years ago. I did not want to be the one to break the machine. I wanted to get a new one that was not broken. It was easy to clean and easy to assemble. I wanted to be able to use"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I first purchased one at The Container Store and used it for over a year.  It's wonderful, especially when I realized it keeps both the dog and baby out of the trash.  So I changed all the trashcans in the house to this.  I'm glad I did because she's already figured out how to open the ""step-on"" type trashcans.

I did buy a target brand touch-top and I returned it after using it for a week.  The touch-top on the target brand broke.  This Sterilite is very heavy duty and I'm so happy I was able to buy a multi-pack from Amazon!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These bags seemed small at first but once I put items in them, I found that they spread out a bit and I was pleasantly surprised at their actual capacity. I'm looking forward to using them this summer when I pickup my CSA share, as the produce is quite fresh and therefore still has dirt on it. This will allow for me to shake off the dirty and not get the insides of my normal grocery bags all dirty. They are nice and small so that I can easily always have one on hand too. I like that they are all natural cotton and free trade."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I wasn't really pleased with the SpaceSaver. My husband and I tried several times to keep the air from coming out of the bags. I did exactly what it says on the directions. Put the items in the bag, zip up the top very secure, suck the air out of the bag with a vaccum, put the cap back on very tightly. I then listened for any air coming out of the top and out of the cap and didn't hear anything. However, the air seems to always come out of the bags either overnight or after a few days. I found it to be useless."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this for about 6 months and it is FABULOUS to sleep on. About a half inch or so of sinking in that is more like molding to your frame and a really pretty firm sleep under that. It's Not Plush. It's very comfortable and I always sleep well and wake up well on this mattress. I used to have a $2500 Serta Perfect Night that I loved and I like this one even more than that. I am buying 2 more of these. They are really really great.  Look around at prices because they can very by $100, even on the full size."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"We have one of these and it is the best. I will keep it for a long time.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it.  It is well made and does not slip or crack.  I have no complaints"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I absolute love this sharpener!!  I love the feel of the handle and how it slides around the blade. I had to replace a couple of the blades because of the shape of the blade. I still use it every day, and it's great. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sharpener that will make a difference in your kitchen. These are great. I just wish they were a bit longer. They fit perfectly on my bed, and I'm very happy with them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This is the best food processor I have ever used. I use it for my frozen fruit and vegetables.  I love the fact that it can get the job done.  I use it to make my own bread in the oven.  I have had it for two months now and it works well.  I love the fact that I can use it on my counter top to store all my food.  I have a lot of fresh veggies and I like that I can store them in it.  I also like the fact that
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I purchased another set of this set and they look just like the original one. I am not sure how well they hold up but I think they are okay.I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect size for my needs.  I love how the blades are stainless steel and have a great range of blades.  I also love the fact that the blade is just a little smaller than the blade it is on.  I will buy another set for my kids to use with their knives as they are
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"We've had this two years now.  We use it sporadically, so perhaps 80-100 oranges in those two years.  It is plastic and it was $20, but somehow it does not seem cheap (pieces fit well, plastic is strong).  But no issues or no complaints so far.  Nothing has broken, and it just works.  Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.  One reviewer complained about batteries....unit plugs in, no batteries, so at least 1 false negative review.

03/2018: still going."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"There are 4 levels with manual switch with no fancy lights, however that's just what we need for an air purifier, nothing more. The lowest one is so quiet that I can hardly hear it even I am 2 feet away, the second lowest is still very quiet and good for sleep. The strongest is not to bad either and can get air move fast.

I developed allergy to my cat during pregnancy and after using this product, my airway cleaned over night. No more sneezes. Now I trust it to be in my nursery to accompany my baby and filter the questionable air we breath in Manhattan."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"expensive but I'd have to say this is state of the art in air filtration.

if you are going the trouble of mitigating a problem or concern with the air in your home not buying the best product available is wasting what ever is spent on a lesser product.

the added expense of this model is clearly value added in the controls, noise levels, and design of intake and exhaust.

the replacement filter cost is comparable to the single filter 400 series.

this is my second blue air purchased. my 400 ran flawlessly if loudly for 12 years and was still working when donated it to the local hospice's thrift store"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"WOW!!!!  Outstanding grabber.  I use this to extend my reach from my wheelchair.  I have purchased a number of different grabbers over the years and most are flimsy and little more that junk.  This grabber, because it is made for grabbing trash and not for disabled use, is ultra sturdy, has great grip strength and will probably outlast me.  The only change I would make if I could, would be to have it 2 or 3 inches shorter.  It was designed for people walking and picking up trash so when I am sitting down, it is just a bit to long."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Super easy set up.  We have the wide wooden legs of our Ikea, the upright one is a little too tall for the most typical shelf, the upright one is a little too short.  We have been using this in our bed for about a year now and it has not moved.  It is very easy to store and clean.  We have several different type of shelves, one is quite large and the other is quite small.  I have a cabinet in our home that we have to get rid of the shelves because"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I had a ho-hum stainless steel set and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It's not. I am a firm believer that if you don't have a metal pot, it's going to be a pain to clean. This set is far superior. I have used it with a pot of orange juice and it's been great. I also use it with a glass of wine and it's not hard to clean. I would recommend this set for any kitchen or dining room."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"This might be useful with some containers, as long as you keep your hands on the handle and the bottom is not too close to the bottom.  The plastic lid on the top is nice, and it fits nicely in the container.  I wish it was a bit thicker, but it works well.  I love the color, and the fact that it is a solid glass.  I just wish there was a bit more depth to it, because it is so very thin.  I have had it for a few months now,"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I had an empty corner that had the pieces on it but it was too small for the cup.

I had to replace the cups and then the plastic cups.

I was so happy to find this in a large, well-made, and well-made house. I love it. I have a large family and I can't wait to use it for Christmas gifts. I just love the look of it. I'm very pleased with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Exactly what it claims to do - they are well constructed and have served us well. We got tired of using those disposable chopsticks that come with take-out and having to ensure that there were no extraneous ""splinters"". Because of its construction, as well as it's material, it is a great set of chopsticks for people to learn with, unlike the slippery plastic / resin / metal versions. In fact, I like these chopsticks more than other fancier sets that I own just because they are easier to use and hold food better. They hold up well in the dishwasher and for my money, it's a great value."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My 2nd one!!!  I ordered a queen for my guest room a few years ago.  My husband detests ""heavy"" blankets and I was having trouble finding a lightweight one we both liked.  I pulled this off the guest bed and put it on our king to make sure he liked it -- he loved it.  I ordered it in the king for our bed the only trouble was I had a duvet liner from IKEA in the queen that I couldn't get in a king.  I simply ordered 2 twins and sewed together as other liners I tried were heavier than we desired."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These lights add a nice warm accent to my bedroom.  I wrapped them around the canopy posts of my bed and it looks very inviting and calming.  They are bright enough but not so bright that it is hard to look at.  They don't seem to heat up too hot although I don't check that very often since they are up so high.  They just add a lovely feature to my room that lights it with a warm tone that seems to make everything else in my room look nicer than it really is so I always have them on if guests come over!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Would give it a five store but as you probably know it is lots n lots of parcel board. It is very easy to put together, except the knobs stink, they were very hard to screw in and very cheap like everyone else commented. My biggest problem is it wasn't very deep, so if you are like me and passed up reading the measurements then this might be good knowing. I had bought mine to put towels in but it cannot fit them, so now I store toilet paper in it. Anyhow, other than that it looks nice fully functional other then it needing additional shelving inside :)"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I have used this whisk for a couple of weeks and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The whisk is a little too strong and the whisk is too short. I would definitely buy this one again if I could.The shape of the rubber seal is great for holding the oil in place. I have had it for a few days now and I love it! I highly recommend it!I am so happy with this product.  It's very easy to use and the color is very vibrant

I've been drinking it a lot since I was a child and 11 years ago I quit drinking soda so now I'm almost exclusively drinking water this PUR is perfect.  You can use it anywhere, and it's easy to set up.  Simply follow the instructions in the box and within a few minutes you can have fresh filtered water ready to drink.  I filled it to put in our spare fridge to have water available in an emergency or when working in the yard.  I tested the PUR filter pitcher for free, but all opinions are my own."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"The 2 pack Standard pillows are TERRIBLE! First of all, they are not the same as the Queen sized. I purchased 2 of the queen pillows and I am VERY pleased with them. So much, that I decided to buy some standard size for our guest room. Instead of buying the Standard size, I went for the 2 pack deal. To my surprise they are NOT THE SAME! They were packed, jammed packed, into a small postal service box. BURSTING at the seams!! After taking them out, I noticed they are super flat, and barely any down alternative filling in them. DO NOT BUY the 2 pack Standard pillows!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I bought the 20-piece set as a trial, along with some Wallace flatware that cost a bit more.
I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.
But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"I've had this cooler for a couple of years now and I'm still happy with it. It is so quiet and the plastic parts are very sturdy. It does take a little getting used to, but it's a breeze to clean. I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm looking forward to the next one. I hope it lasts a long time. We love this set.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,I picked this up because it has the design and design of a Grosse Pointe Clipper. It's not the best but it's good enough for me. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have a portable fan that I can use for a lot of things. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is loud and a little loud for me. I have had no problems with the fan.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Very good product. BUT, it is a very thin piece of plastic that is hard to remove. If you want to remove it, you have to put a piece of plastic in the center of it and then screw it in. Otherwise, it's very thin. I received a 2nd one at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Thank you. We love this set. I love the color and the size. We are very happy with our purchase. This is my second coffee maker."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"It works pretty good. Doesn't heat my bigger candles to the point of filling the room with an aroma even close to lighting it. The smaller candles smell wonderful using this candle warmer though, without any combustion or smoke, so that's great. Buyer beware though, this is made of plastic which means it is very unsafe to use more than a couple of hours or the plastic may begin to melt. Most companies have moved over to ceramic candle warmers to avoid this issue, but if you just want something cheap and you are not a forgetful person then this candle warmer is stellar and sits at a great price."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"If you ever peel potatoes you have to have this. It is such a good peeler.
I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit or veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit or veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."

This one takes conscious effort to move so it has not been stolen out from under my head in the middle of the night.  It stays cool and keeps it's shape well.  The outside cover comes of for easy washing.  Great pillow.
NOTE:  If your hubby/partner likes to fold your pillows in half and lay on them then make sure to order an extra one because they are definitely not as nice after that happens.  It's like after being squished like that they lose a bit of their soul."

They are made of high quality material and are attractive. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.I bought this to put in my closet to store things in.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Really cute in theory. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't correct these flaws numerous people have informed them of since it is a really pretty design. Just makes you think they don't care, and if they don't why should anyone else?"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These along with a wide-mouth jar coffee filter have stepped my coldbrew game to a new level.  We prefer lattes generally, so I'll brew a bottle and split the coffee between two mason jars, then add milk & sweetener to taste.  Pour top goes on then in the fridge, ready & waiting to caffeinate our bleary brains long before things like brewing or pouring milk make any sense to a sleep-addled, decaffeinated mind.

Seal on these is decent, though I still keep my finger over the flip top when shaking.  Only complaint is that the flip top likes to flip closed while pouring if you don't hold it open."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a powerful little vacuum and really is a pet hair eraser.  I had to rush my german shepherd to the vet the other day and didn't have enough time to cover the car seats.  Consequently, every seat in the car was literally covered in fur.  I used the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum this morning and within one hour my car looked new inside again.  It has a very strong suction, and the pink rubber tip loosens the hair that sticks to the upholstery so it can be easily vacuumed.  I highly recommend this little gem and the price makes it even better!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm a big V60 fan. To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America. The only real gripe with this pourover method is the filters. At the mercy of these pricey things. I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I like my old beanbag, it's lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not a problem.I was excited to get this set for my daughter's first party.  She's a huge fan of the ""Star Wars"" set and so I was very excited to get a set of these as well.  The ""Star Wars"" set is very light and very colorful, and I love the colors, too. "

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have just purchased my second of these mixers, as my daughter ""burned out"" the first making cookies (snickerdoodles - not that heavy).  That I am buying another is a reflection of what I like about it - it is very effective in light tasks, from whipping cream to mixing cakes.  It is comfortable in my hands, sits on the counter in a stable fashion when I am scraping the bowl, and ejects the beaters easily.  However it is not meant for heavy tasks - for that I have a KitchenAid stand mixer (of course).  So I gave it a 4 only because it is not really powerful."

I've owned roughly a dozen garlic presses in my lifetime, and this one far exceeds the performance of the best of said dozen.  The build is of the same thoughtfully engineered quality that you would expect from OXO and fits comfortably in my hand.  Let me also say that I never realized how much I needed those non-slip rubber handles until I had them.  Easy to clean and dishwasher safe too?  Wow!  Look no further!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Since I got a dog with a double coat, this has been a lifesaver whenever I see some hair stuck in corners. I hate using our large vacuum more than once a week, so between the roomba and this small handy tool our floor is kept really clean, even during shedding season. I also used it to vacuum my car and got through the backseats and the passenger seat before it ran out of battery, and my car was NOT clean at all when I started, so I think the battery lasts a good 15-20 minutes on a full charge. This has got to be one of my best purchases this year!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought 2 and they are functional but made from cheaper material than I expected.

This isn't a deal breaker for me, but be forewarned, they seem to be made out of aluminum that is only slightly thicker than a disposable casserole pan (that can be purchased from the grocery store).

Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.

If you are looking for something fancy, this probably isn't for you. If however you are looking for an inexpensive way to contain grease splatter, then you will be pleased with this product."

I had a friend who was a bit overweight and wanted to take it to work. She had her own in the dining room and it was perfect. She was very happy with the product. She loved it. I did have to make sure the pieces fit perfectly so I could use it on the counter to store it. I am very happy with it.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm sure I will use it for many years"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I was shocked to see that it was the only part of the product that did not have the extra suction.  The plastic part is also designed to be ""good"" for suction.  I would not be surprised if it came with some kind of ""dug"" that would allow it to ""handle"" the suction.  However, it is a little difficult to use because the suction is not strong enough to grip the plastic part with a good grip.  The suction is also very strong, so I would not expect it to hold"

I make handcrafted greeting cards, and use a lot of different punches in my creations: border punches, corner punches, flower/leaf/branch punches, snowflakes, tags, circles, etc. etc.

This organizer works perfectly!  The clear pockets allow me to see the punches, and I have easy access to them.  Some of my punches are ""mega"" size, and they fit perfectly into the pockets.  For smaller punches, I can store several related punches in a single pocket.

Very happy with the purchase so far -- it seems to be holding up well (after about 6 weeks of use)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I bought this (not on Amazon) to replace a Cuisinart CPT-180 which I moved to my 2nd home in FL, and still works well. I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"These are terrible for scooping icecream. I think its because the slider piece is not close enough to the scoop... the icecream gets stuck & the scoop gets stuck out, so you must have super human strength to squeeze open or close  the handle & even then, the icecream doesn't come out.  I have tried soaking in hot water & it just makes a mess of melted icecream. These Look like the real thing (there are some that look like these that are much better quality!)  I used the smaller one for cookie dough & that one actually works quite well. Maybe I got a dud on the big one."

It is large enough for me, so soft, and I love the front zipper pouch to protect valuables while you snooze...or in my case snacks.

We used this with kids on one event and then with adults for a ""Gourmet S'more"" party - I think the adults had more fun with it than the kids!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I purchased this for my new loveseat. Its add says ""fits most loveseats"" . I would argue that. The cover is quite small and barely covers 3/4 of the seating area. It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.  I probably would have returned it but it was worth my time and the price of the product. I would not recommend."

The screw has sharp edges like a drill bit. It cuts into the cork and provides a good grip on it so it doesn't break or split when you pull it out of the bottle. the bottle stopper is, likewise, a quality item. It is metal and fits nicely in a wine bottle.

It is really nothing more than a big mason jar with a stainless steel infuser, but it works perfectly and makes it possible to enjoy totally individualized iced tea or coffee.

It also comes with a hard plastic blade guard that protects the blade when it's tossed in a drawer.  Like others, I purchased this item for the wrong reason (in order to qualify for the extra $25 off an order of $125 or more), but I am certainly glad I did.

5/11/06:  This peeler also does a fine job on ripe tomatoes (for those who do not wish to peel using the traditional scalding method).

The panel was tricky to align with right angles and keep at the right height. It might be easier with two people. Otherwise, it's very easy for one person to put together in very little time.

It's a sturdy piece. It works really well for me as a printer stand and the shelves are perfect for printer paper and other supplies. It is significantly cheaper than other printer stands and would also be great for its intended use as a nightstand.

The chocolate color would go well with darker stained wood furniture or black furniture (I have both in the room)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I acquired this amazing product for cheap from BestBuy, because I think Dyson was renaming their DC series to ""V6"" at the time. In the past, the thought of dealing with cords and heavy vacuums typically prevailed over my urge to keep things clean, until such a time when everything just became intolerably dusty. However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

But what really inspired me to write this review was how awesomely and effectively this thing sucks up and kills bugs. Turn the ""Max"" setting on and no insect or arachnid shall escape its wrath. Suck them up from five feet away, spin them around and they are dead. I love this thing."

Functionally the mug works fine, and the artwork is attractive. I paid a little more for this than I normally would for a similar mug thinking I was getting something special, but other than the artwork it is just a cheap travel mug.

The words ""America"" and ""American"" appear about a dozen times on the packaging, along with words like ""authentic"" and ""pride."" Apparently American Expedition takes pride in America, just not enough to have their products made here."

The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white? It is unbelievably noisy when operating and couldn't possibly be used any place you want to have a conversation. If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it. BTW, there's now a 2-bottle version. It doesn't work any better."

The only thing that I do not like is that the handle is very short.  This is a problem for me.  I prefer to have a knife that I can grip over the handle.  I like the blade for my hands, but I like the handle for my hands because it allows me to carry knives in the hand without having to worry about pulling them out.  This is a little bit small for"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,These have a heavy base and an easy to grip handle.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because the box is a bit small but the plastic lid does hold it together.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid was cracked.  The lid is not a very strong lid.  I will update if I have any issues with the lid.  I just put the lid on and the lid is on.  I will update if I have any problems with the lid.These are great.  I love that they are made of fiberglass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I tried these twice - one on the side and one on the back of my car seat. The other two had the same problem, but they're the same product. They were made of plastic and had no seams. I'm not sure why. I'm sure it was because the machine is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. I'm not sure why. I'm sure it was because the machine is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but I'm not sure. I don't know why. I would buy this again.This is a beautiful mug."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"The shape is a little more bulky than the picture. I will admit that it's been a little difficult to get the hang of, but it is the perfect size for a 4'2"" queen bed. It will be a perfect size for my daughters room.It was very easy to install.  I have a 2 year old who can't move on his feet so I installed it on his bed.  I love the fact that it is so easy to clean and dry.  I have had no problems with the silicone.  I love that it is made of glass. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have bought this type of fuel for years not only for myself but for my wine and coffee cafe. I also have several different fireplace types I use it in. My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

Highly recommend this product. Will be buying regularly."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,What a great vacuum. I read the review first and you all were right. I thought my old vacuum was great but I did a pass with that then I did a pass with the Hoover and was grossed out!!! I could not believe all the additional cat/dog hair that it pulled out of the carpet. My back is not so great but this is easy to handle. This is my first bagless system and I really thought I would hate it but it empties out very easy & goes right back on the system with no problem. I only wish the hose was a bit more flexible but I believe over time it will become more stretchable.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This caddy is really solid and well made. I had an old metal one that I tossed in favor of this one. I have bamboo cutting boards and since I know bamboo stands up well to water, this was an easy purchase for me. It does not fit over my soaking tub and isn't adjustable, but fits in my standard tub in my guest bath. It gives the guest bath a spa-type feel. It can be used on a dresser or counter top in addition to the tub. It's spacious and securely holds wine glasses. If this had rubber grips for on the edge of the tub, I'd rate it 5 stars, but overall I really like it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I thought this was pretty great when I got it. But I have reconsidered. Stick blender cracked shortly after I got it, although it still worked. It has a (horrendous - for me) protective cover over the blades which is often in the way. The stick part really needs to be put in the dishwasher to clean it. I think that the problem is that it does too many things, and lacks the simplicity of a standard sort of stick blender. Also, the 'stick' attaches awkwardly to the motor. Mine just broke. The old standard one which I gave away worked forever.

OTOH, it is powerful, and if you don't mind the hooded blades might be just the thing."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased this mat to go with the wide wooden legs of my Ikea shower curtain.  It is so sturdy and the seams are thick and clear.  It looks great in my bathroom.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size to fit the towel rack.  I would buy them again.  I am very pleased with this product.I love these bowls! They are so easy to clean, and I use them everyday for our dinner. I have a couple"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,I've been using this chair for a couple of weeks and I'm very happy with the way it's done. I had a similar chair before and it seemed to be a great quality and was comfortable. I'm happy with this chair.I use this as a desk for my husband. He works a lot and I love the color and the fact that it's reversible. He has a lot of stuff in there and I like the fact that it's reversible. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of things. The base is made of solid wood so it doesn't sit on

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Just received this set.  It is soooo cute!!!  We go camping and this will look really good on our picnic table!!!  It is a nice size.  The mustard and ketchup are smaller than the pair you see sitting on cafe tables...which is nice when you have limited space in the fridge.  The salt and pepper shakers are a larger size.  The colors on the website and on the box are the same colors as the actual products; including the picnic table.  The weight of this set is enough to hold the table cloth down if it is breezy.  Another ""must buy"" for those of us that like this kind of thing!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I wanted a chair that wasn't too heavy to lug upstairs or that would destroy my carpet with the rollers and I wanted easy assembly and comfort.  This chair has it.  I searched the web and the price was right.  I ordered it and it was delivered two days later which was amazing for free shipping.

The instructions are easy to follow and it took me 20 minutes to put in and tighten the screws.  I find it has good back support and the adjustable arms fit nicely with my computer desk.  The chair swivels easily and is adjustable in height.

I don't think it was overpriced because I searched the web and found it reasonable."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Does what it's supposed to, I guess. It is a little too wide of an opening for our skinny fake tree, which looks a little odd-I can arrange it so it fits better though. If we ever decide to get a real (thicker) tree it'll work out better. It isn't the best tree skirt but it isn't the worst. The characters are cute. The material is a heavier felt. I don't buy anything expensive because I have a 3 year old who is the destroyer of all nice things. This isn't going to be advertised on the cover of Martha Stewart living's tree skirt of the season, but if you just need something cheap quick this should work fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This is a a very nice set and the price is good.  I have a few of the other two sets that I bought, but they are the ones that I have purchased for myself.  I have been in the market for a set for years and this is the one for me.  It is a good size and very durable.  I am very happy with this purchase.I just bought a new Amazon Prime Prime membership for my 6 year old daughter.  She loves it!  I love it!  It has a magnet, which is great, and is easy to use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I bought two packs of this set and they look just like the picture, just the same color.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it, it keeps things organized and easy to clean.  I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter's room. They are perfect for her"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm happy with it. I've had it for a year and I'm happy with it. Very pretty. I bought this for a friend, and she is very pleased with the quality. The color is beautiful and the material is very thin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great stainless steel dishwasher. I also love the fact that it is a non-stick surface, and that it can be washed with soap and water. I will buy another for her in the future. I'm very pleased with the quality of this item."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"We use these on multi-sizes of mason jars for our 7 year old (larger jar) and our 4 year old (smaller jar) and they work perfectly. Although not entirely spill proof which is why I only gave it 4 stars, the kids are neat enough to not create spills. I could see that being a problem for other kids however. Even with that, I would buy again and recommend as a good purchase for anyone looking for drinking covers for mason jars, which for us is our favorite cup for the kids. We haven't really used the straws but I do like them and they are durable to last a while. When we use them I will update this review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Nice to see that some things are still made in America. I had a Swing-A-Away that lasted for  years but, finally gave up the ghost. In looking around for a replacement I was disappointed to see literally everything MIFC (I think you get the meaning). Luckily, I stumbled across this product on Amazon. It's heavy duty and well made-should last for years.

It's not perfect, though. The handles are bulkier than the Swing-Away. And, it doesn't work very well on flat aluminum cans-the kind that kipper snacks come in (I ended up crushing one of these cans in attempting to open it-I had a real mess). Overall, I still think it's a great, well made product that I would recommend."

After a 9-day camping trip, I can say that it worked pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. A few of my cinnamon rolls still burned a little while others weren't cooked through, but it was definitely an improvement over using without. I noticed the most improvement when cooking a skillet of bacon. I didn't have a hot spot in the middle of the pan that burned my bacon while the rest stubbornly refused to cook. And nothing is more sad than overcooked bacon. Nothing."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,We bought this for my daughter's wedding. It is a little bigger than my previous one and we have two small dogs and I am worried that she may be allergic to it.I have had this for about 6 months now and it works great. I love it!The shape is perfect and it's great for holding the pillows in place. I didn't realize how much more room I had until I put it on the pillow and it was perfect! It's very comfortable to sleep on. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to use for her bedding and she loves
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Keeps coffee hot at a time. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the coffee in the container. I wish I'd bought the plastic one first. I used to go through a couple of cups of water a day and it would be fine. I would have loved to have a smaller one. I did get a glass one and it is a little heavier than I expected. It does hold a decent amount of water. It's easy to clean and not too heavy for me to get into a coffee cup. I really like that it has a coffee maker.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I absolutely love this print/design!  I love the look and feel of this print, the color and the appearance.  I've used it on my son's bed, on a bedding frame, and on his bed in the living room.  I love it!  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few more things I'd like to add to the collection!I use this to make homemade coffee and it is great!  It's easy to clean and easy to clean!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This pattern is a beautiful subtle pattern with a wide decorative floral and leaves border that is a very subtle silver color that is only a little darker than the white porcelain of the plate. On each edge of the border pattern their is a band of shimmering platinum accents. A very nice setting to be sure. As always, it arrived safely with no breakage at all.

This is for one place setting. You get one dinner plate, one salad plate, one butter plate and one cup and saucer. A very pretty place setting. Add to your collection or mix and match. they are beautiful any way you choose to display them. The same excellent quality that you would expect from Lenox."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows. I think the most surprising thing about this clock was the fact that the protection only stays on for a short period of time. Perhaps even only 60 seconds then shuts off. Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,OKAY FINAL HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM I SAID EARLIER THAT THEY WORK'D FINE BUT NOW THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM I FIND THEM LIGHT MEANING ONCE PUT THEM IN THE PAN AN CRACK THE EGG INSIDE THE EGG RUNS UNDERNEATH RING SO I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO FIND A PAN THAT'S FLAT IN ORDER FOR THE EGG NOT TO RUN UNDERNEATH IT ALSO I WISH IT A HAD A SCREW TO MAKE THE CIRCLE SMALLER SO THAT THE EGG WOULD COOK THICKER ...

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I've always been a fan of the suction cups. I also love that they have a one-to-two-cup design, which is great for making a smoothie or other quick-drying meals.

The suction cups are thin and compact. They also have a rubber seal to prevent them from cracking when they are used.

The suction cups also have a removable top that can be used to hold the coffee in the container.

The suction cups have a flexible tip that allows you to pull the coffee out of the container without tipping it over.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This is really handy.  We have a wide variety of containers and this one is perfect.  It is so easy to use.  We also have the Tumbler, which is great.

I have a few of these on my kitchen counter, so I am very pleased with this purchase. It is very heavy. I am very happy with it, and I am very happy"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"A very good non-slip mat for use with any dough owing to its large 16"" size. The circle guides are helpful and the information on the sides are for quick look-up. Most dough would stick to it if you do not use flour (good for some doughs).  Also, it's slightly non-stick nature means you do not have to use too much flour for rolling. The mat sticks to the surface of the counter as long as the surface is clean and smooth. So, no problem with that. It is very thin and light not bulky. And it folds up easily for proper storage. I just use damp paper towel (or wet) to clean the mat and air dry it by hanging."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Blueair recommends changing the filters for their air purifiers every six months.

The entire system is not inexpensive because the purifier is expensive and the replacement filters seem relatively expensive.

However, the performance is valuable for anyone with allergies. By the time my filters are changed, there is noticeable build-up of particles so I know that this is something that we would be breathing in if not for the purifier.

When I think about what our purifier does, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year, I am appreciative for our cleaner air and decreases allergy reactions. The cost of the filter, changed twice a year, is approximately $0.45/day. For me, and my family, this is a good deal!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These were a little smaller than I had intended, but that's because I didn't pay attention to the size in ounces and then go compare them to one of my older glasses that are similar. But, you know what? That's GOOD, because I'm less likely to overdrink various poured liquids that are high in calories. I like THAT. And, they're less fragile as a result. I'm impressed by the fact that these are more durable in their base than the larger ones I used to break too often, being glass. So, it all works out. They're also easily cleaned by hand; whereas, the larger ones I had were deep and harder to get into the corners of inside the base."

cute

love it!This is a great little coffee maker.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the coffee is very hot.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the coffee with a single spoon.  I just have to pull the coffee out of the machine, because it will eventually melt.  The machine is very quiet, and the coffee tastes good.  I'm very happy with this purchase"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I am using them with a set of wide wooden legs for a travel trailer. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The legs are tall enough to accommodate large spaces. They are heavy and sturdy. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.I bought this to put in my closet to store things in. It's a nice size and looks great. I just put it in the laundry room and put it in the shower. I love the way it looks. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to use for her kitchen projects and she loved them!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

Update 12/14/2010.  This was my first experience returning a purchase to Amazon.  The process was painless, and the refund was quick."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased these after buying from another seller. These are a bit more cost wise... but much better quality. The others had crystals that looked very clear online, but they are foggy. I purchased these from PuTwo. And they are clear as pictured. They look amazing, and am only sorry for those who have only seen and gotten the others. 10/10 would order again. They are really nice. And they are packaged well too, more than I can say for the others. They came with a nice strong resealable bag to save the unused ones. I was really nice to have these for a bridal shower.

Would love to see them make longer ones. But I will be buying these again in the future."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"i have been using this little juicer on a daily basis, sometimes with lime or lemon, but most times with oranges.  it is solid build and easy to use.  however i could think of few improvements (hence the 4 stars rating):

 - the holes can be made larger.  right now a lot of the holds are covered by the pulp after only juicing half orange so frequent cleaning is needed (i also drink the pulp)
 - the bottom bowl can be made slightly larger, the top bowl is a good side but it can not be used to catch the juice

anyway, i would recommend it to people with some wrist power b/c you have to push it down and twist."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've been looking for something like this for a long time and I'm glad I found it. Tacos finally make sense for modern living. I guess in the old days you just held your taco shell while mama filled it and you held it in your hand, no plate or anything to worry about, not even the dirt floor, the dog cleaned that. But we don't do it that way. We put more than tacos and more than one at a time, so we lose the contents before we get to them. I like these and the service was great. I suppose the price might have been lower for what they are, but they are worth even more to me in peace of mind."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Planning a wedding can get kind of crazy. My wedding is in 5 days and I realized I completely forgot to buy a serving set! I thought this set looked pretty cute with the hearts on the metal and it was cheap enough for me to get last minute so I bought it. When it got here last night I opened the box to see if it came in one piece and oh my gosh!!! It is even more beautiful in person!!! The pictures don't do it justice at all!! The handle is a soft white (which actually matches my dress!) and it has little soft gold hearts at the bottom and its very sturdy! I'm so glad I didn't go with anything else!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I would have said I love it, but gosh, it's just a pitcher.  On the other hand, it's a better pitcher than I have had in a long time.  Its narrow profile and non-spill lid are great in the refrigerator.  I made concentrated orange juice in it recently and was able to shake the container without spilling a drop; that's not something every pitcher can say.  I was disappointed that it was plastic, but I guess it could be uncomfortably heavy if it weren't.  And the best part of all: it's made in the United States.  Since I'm trying to stay away from any products that will be used for food made in China, that is recommendation enough."

I did not want to have to replace it every day. This is a very good buy. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate clock.Very nice and strong. I would highly recommend.I have a small kitchen and this is perfect! I have a KitchenAid mixer and this is perfect"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"On of the problems with this set, the only thing I did not like is the size of the bottom plate. The plate is too small and the top plate is too large. I have had no issues with this plate, it is very thin and holds a lot of liquid. I would not recommend this product. Very good quality. Can't wait to use it. I just bought this to use in a hamper. I like that it's so easy to store. I've used it for a year and it is working great. I'm very happy with it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"While our preference was The Mighty Mug vortex, which is actually a clear cup, we weren't willing to spend nearly $20 a cup ( the price as of today). So we simply use the  mug with the lid off. We only had to show the grandkids how to lift the mug straight up rather than at an angle and that was that. Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.

Tip: if you have wood tables simply use a ceramic or glass flat salad plate to hold the mug. . It works fine.

We don't use this as a travel mug or with the lid on, except to keep coffee piping hot till we want to drink it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"My son is all about racecars, and loves this toybox. It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the decorating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Pro it seems comfortable. Cons; first, it doesn't feel comfortable. Second, the handle has a slight clunk. Third, the lid is a bit too short. The lid is still very comfortable. I can't imagine how this could be improved. I'm not a fan of the sticky feel of plastic and it is a little uncomfortable. So I will probably not buy this product again. However, I would not have given it five stars if it were not for the fact that the handle is a little short."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,I just opened this item and it was the best. I will keep my review for a couple months. If you want to get a solid product then the Treme Tops should work for you. I have been using this in my bed for about a week now and it has not moved. I put it on the bed and it is very comfortable and it is a great quality. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it and it is a good size for my queen size bed. I am hoping that it will last for years to come. I will definitely be ordering another one. I am happy with this
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"I wanted to be sure that it was the best. I did not need a replacement vacuum, but I wanted one that worked. The attachments to the box were a bit of a pain to install, but it was a good value. The size was perfect and the holes were very easy to install. The bottom was a bit rough, but the holes were not that big so I could use it to put my nails in. I am very happy with this purchase. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerator and it's working fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I purchased this in an attempt to help my wife (who has chronic neck pain) have more support in the car.  She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she forgot it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,This knife was bought out of an online seller and is listed at $29.95.  It is so cheap that it is a must have for the kitchen.  The handle is nice and sharp and it is a good value.  I would definitely recommend this knife.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old who can use it on his first day of school.  It has a nice handle and seems sturdy.  It is easy to clean and easy to clean.  I would highly recommend this knife.I really love these.  I put them in a refrigerator and it's a real breeze to put
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I admit, I was a little skeptical when I first saw this, but it really is a pretty good product. I had a lot of thought and then the instruction booklet came out and it was just as well. It was a little difficult to use, but I think it was worth it. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works great. I am very pleased with it. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I'm usually sceptical of 'aspects' (the materials in this particular model are not the same as the other ones I've seen).  I have used the Tumbler for several weeks now and it seems to be working just fine.  I wish it was a bit thicker and not heavier.  It's a good product and I'm very happy with it.  I like the size and the fact that it has a nice handle to hold it.  It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food, so I would definitely recommend it.  I haven't had a problem with it and am happy"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock for safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I needed a multi-color comforter or quilt and this looked like it would work and the reviews were good.  It is just perfect.  It had a chemical smell when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it along with the shams, no more problem there.  And it washed up beautifully - no shrinkage at all. It is a very colorful and rich look for our guest bedroom. You could use just about any color of sheets with this and it will look great. I like having a quilt instead of my usual comforter sets because of the fact that it is easily washable at home - and if you have kids or pets, that is a good thing."

As you can hear in the video, the fan now makes a loud grinding noise when in use.  It is useless to me now.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"This mister was not as advertised.  Even the instructions had misspelled and/or missing words.  The tubing was hard plastic and was difficult to work with.  After I finally attached the tubing to my floor fan with the tiny zip ties furnished, I screwed in the ""nozzles"" and secured my water hose to the inlet and turned the water on.  The nozzles were a screw-in type and were cheaply made because they leaked.  I tried every water pressure possible to try to make this work, but the nozzles either ""spit"" or dripped and soaked everything in front of the fan.  The promise of the ""mist evaporating and leaving only cool air"" was totally false.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was looking for a good way to refrigerate wine bottles that are partially empty. If you put a stopper in them and stand them up in the fridge door, they clank and jostle around when you open or close the fridge. And if you lay them on their sides, there's always the chance the stopper you're using won't be as secure as you'd hoped, and you end up with a leaky mess. This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I own a few other komachi knives and this one is no different! They all are sharp and slice very cleanly. I use this one as it suggests for fruits and some vegetables. It's excellent on fruits with a natural wax or tough rind like orange because of the ridging helps keep the item you're slicing on the knife. I've had an orange slip while I was trying to cut it with a smooth blade, not fun. My only qualm is that for some reason this knife's sheath is not like the rest the sheath has a little part that allows it to stand which keeps it from fitting into the drawers with the other knives because it is a bit bulky. But otherwise its a good buy!"

There is absolutely no neck or head support - those cheap pillows they give you on airplanes provide more support than these alleged Dream Supreme pillows. I woke up with a hideous neck-ache, which is not something I've ever experienced before.  Don't waste a dime of your hard-earned money buying these cheap junk pillows with a fancy expensive-sounding alias.  They're j-u-n-k.

Edited to add: Amazon is a world-class five-star company. The return and refund for this purchase was handled without any hassles or problems."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have two of these.  As a long-time composter, this canister is really great.  You definitely need the charcoal filters to keep odor at bay (unless you empty it every day, which I dont) but the stainless steel is tough and cleans completely with little effort.  I have banged this around, kicked the lid across the floor (accidentally) and dropped it full, onto my stone floor from counter height and the worst I got was a minor dent.  I have banged it hard on the composter, in effort to dislodge stuck-on stuff and the edge still looks perfect.  FOr all the abuse I put this thing through, I couldn't have made a better choice.  Yes I highly recommend it.  Order extra filters."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This is my second Cuisinart hand blender in this model (I sadly left the older model in Texas with a friend) and I am incredibly disappointed in the new ""feature"" of having to hold down the speed button and then, USING ANOTHER HAND, press the ""lock"" button. It's not like the lock button is in an easy to reach place with one's fingers...nope, it's right at the top of the device, making it impossible to safely reach around, up, or over with the same hand, thus rendering this once single-hand device useless as a single-hand device.
You really hosed this one, Cuisinart, and it's probably because you had to because some twat stuck their finger in the blades at one time, so now the rest of us suffer thanks to idiots."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I originally bought these glasses on June 29th, 2016. At the time, I thought these were outstanding glasses and rated 5 stars.

Today, August 7th, 2017, one of the Bormioli Rocco glasses exploded spontaneously inside the dishwasher while it was OFF.
The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

I just read other reviews of customers claiming these glasses also exploded on them.. I had no injuries but many others did.
Do not buy them unless you want to risk yourself and your loved ones with them."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've been using these as condiment bottles, filled with condiments from our bulk sized containers. The tips are pretty small, but I like that for condiments that aren't meant to be chunky (so, not relish). I started using one for pancakes awhile back, and occasionally the tip would get clogged from the batter, I noticed then that the tips are pretty thick, and I couldn't cut through one to change the size. I ended up taking a sharp knife with a fine point and kind of carved away at the opening to make it just a bit bigger. A friend also took a file type thing to hers, it's like a long chopstick, but the entire surface was a file.
Anyways, I've liked these well enough, and I'm glad I got them."

The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac.
Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product."

The length I wanted (91 inches) wasn't in stock so I got these longer, 108 inch ones. WOW- they look just like beautiful raw silk and they are such a beautiful color. The length wasn't even too bad but I decided to use some hem tape so they just break about 1-2 inches on the floor. They were wrinkly from being packaged up so I ironed them a little, which was very easy. I will definitely be buying more curtains like these in the future!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."

I will say that I had to use a different knife to get it cut with a knife, so I have not had to get one yet. The smaller cut I got is better quality, but I still have a steak cut that is a bit smaller than the one I got."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I purchased this in blue to put under my dining room table to protect the wood floors.

Also, if you have pets you can see just about every bit of hair on it. I wished I wouldn't of purchased this but it's too late. Not absolutely horrible- just not for me.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I purchased this to replace the Capresso 560 grinder after it broke. The Capresso grinder is quieter, but I love the simplicity of this grinder. Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This paper towel stand is sturdy but light.  The decorative design dresses your paper towel roll up just a bit in your kitchen.  It's a fine product and offered at a fair price.

After using this for a while, taking off a star.  The base is slightly wobbly which is annoying.  However, the price is low.  So it's still an okay product.

UPDATE 11/3/15: Dropping this down to two stars.  After only a few months of ownership the simple soldering joints where the vertical poles attach to the base broke.  This holder is decorative.  However, it is cheaply assembled and quality control missed the mark on this one.  We'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.  The brand is fine, but this model is flimsy and weak."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't know if this grill press is the best out there.  It's the first I've owned.  I can say it's been a pleasant surprise.  It's hefty, solid and has large surface area.  It works great to flatten bacon, and speeds up cooking burgers.  It fits well in a large pan or cast iron skillet.  Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

My only complaint, the handle is on a screw, and loosens from time-to-time, requiring a few turns of a screwdriver to tighten back up.  Otherwise I like and recommend this press."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I ordered 2 of these for my kids. The bands are challenging to stretch over the mattress far enough so that when you pull the opposite side to do that band the other end pulls up from the opposite side- not all the way off, but it still is a back and forth. Today after 2 months of use one of the elastic corner bands came apart from the mattress pad. It already broke and I've only taken it off the bed 3 times. A total waste of money. Get the kind that is like a sheet and goes all the way down. I was hoping I could return these and get my money back but my return window closed 2 weeks ago. One of them has never even been out of the package."

It is a good size for her size. I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things. I also use it to store a lot of clothes. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it. It is well made and does not slip or crack. I have no complaints about it, it is very well made and it is a great price. Very nice, great quality. I would recommend."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"It grinds. That is about the best I can say about it. I bought this in April 2017.

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one. But this was a waste of money.

I think I'll go back to the Breville we had for a few years (which ironically had worse reviews than this one!)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Very easy assembly. Set out the pieces and look at how the black clips fit together, then you'll be on your way to a quick and easy assembly.
The cutting board can be inserted either with the ""drip catcher"" grooves up or down. We have a small convection oven and a large toaster on top, so we chose to leave the grooves on the down side.
The top shelf is narrow but is nice for smaller items. The two larger shelves below the wood top now hold a cast iron dutch oven, a bread machine, two crock pots and a set of very large bowls.
The feet are adjustable so that you can level the unit so it won't wobble.
We have this in a narrow hall off the kitchen and it has proven to be an excellent investment."

I also love the fact that it is a non-stick surface, and that it can be washed with soap and water.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"4 1/2 Stars.  I have RA so holding anything can be difficult.  This knife has a rubber grip, it's well balanced, not too heavy and it's very sharp.  Chopping was easy, the knife didn't slip from my hand, it rocks easily, and my hand didn't get tired.  I will keep this in mind when purchasing gifts for family.  It would make a great wedding gift as well.
EDIT 5/18/10
I have now used this knife daily for months and am changing from 4 1/2 to 5 stars. I love this knife. It is easy to use, easy to grip, stays sharp and I tell everyone this is the knife and brand to stay with if you want to be pleased and stay pleased!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Have you ever been bothered by ugly hampers, plastic baskets - making your bedroom look like a mess? Worry no more - because this is ideal product for you ! When I have received it I was surprised that it was so easy to put together and at the same time was very sturdy. It is well made from real bamboo ( no cheap plastic or random tree branches ) - linen inside makes it appear clean ( and you can not really see what is inside ). It is perfect for segregating clothes - whites and colors. Most importantly it is very pretty ! It does not ruin decor in our bedroom and fits right in !!! I would recommend it - price is great, quality is great - nothing more to think about !!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Item came packaged well but it's certainly not high end quality stuff. It works well in the space, for now at least. Very lightweight so I was able to hang using just the adhesive plastic wall hooks, so that's a plus. Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean forward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges. If you're looking to decorate a small wall and not spend too much, then it's not a bad option. Not sure I would buy again but it's decent enough to keep and looks fine in that space."

I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's going to break in the dishwasher. I have had this for two weeks now and love it. I love the fact that I can use the blender with a single hand. I just can't get it to do it all. I have a hard time adjusting the motor speed to make sure it works the right way, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. The motor is a little loud at first, but it's great."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was at first skeptical when I had purchased two of these for my two vehicles.  However, after using them on a 400 mile day trip, these units appear to do the air cleaning job.  My sinuses used to go south when traveling in our SAAB 9-5.  However, with the unit in place, my sinuses were not bothered by the SAAB cabin air quality.  And yes, the cabin filters are changed annually whether they need it or not!

However, when one of the units developed a connectivity issue, E-Mailed the folks at Green Giraffe who promptly replaced the unit without any fuss.  Had the replacement within days and no hassle.  Just great customer service!!  It is hard to find companies with great service as shown by the folks at Green Giraffe."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have another cast iron square grill from Calphalon(?) and after comparing the two I gotta say, Lodge is a lot nicer.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Overall fun to use."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I  chose this alarm because I had owned or used one that looked similar for years--- they were easy to set and were very reliable.  I  was surprised to find the new model is quartz and has a very pleasing blue illumination. It also has a snooze feature that the old one did not have---Ilive in an area that has several power outages a year, and when the power goes off I can look at the clock and can tell exactly when the power went off and can pass that information on to the power company.  I am eighty years old and have owned several clocks that I found impossible to operate,and this model is perfect for my needs.  If I need it I USE my cellphone as a backup----A great product-----"

It has a very nice mug holder, so I don't have to worry about it getting burned when I go to wash it.  I do wish the color was a little brighter, but it's not bad.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a crazy candle lady - I go through so many!  I've always got at least three nice candles in the house and burn them down within a few weeks.  This is one of the better ones and it's around my usual mid-range price point.  The Havana (tobacco) scent is fabulous and unisex; my fiance says it's not an offensive scent, which is a compliment coming from him.  It burns cleanly and evenly from one side of the container to the other.  It doesn't have the best reach like a $60+ candle, but it's better than cheaper candles, and worth it for the pleasant scent.  If you're in the same room you can definitely smell it.  I would consider buying again (even though I'm continuatlly looking for a new scent)!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"While not perfect - this one is much better than the others we tried.  It is larger than the other ones tried and holds more soap = less filling.  It has an off switch which is wonderful when moving it or filling it.  There is a wheel on the side where you can adjust the amount of soap that comes out easily.  The only issue I have had is sometimes it takes 2 times of putting a hand under it in order to get the soap to come out.  I bought one for myself and my son and both are still working after 3 months.  That might not sound like much, but the others we tried quit after less time - some not at all.

I haven't had any problems with any of the attachments I've used, and they seem to work well.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

I will probably just hang the holes up on the frame so I don't have to worry about them falling off. I'm really happy with this purchase. I love that they are made of solid wood. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who enjoys woodworking!I'm a huge fan of the Oster that does exactly what it's supposed to do."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes."

I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."

I will say that I have never had a coffee maker that was too heavy or too small, so I don't have to worry about that. The coffee maker does take a little getting used to, but it is a great value.

Don't let the photos fool you, these glasses are a sturdy set, feel great to hold with a medium weight and hold a lot.  I am currently using them for water, or iced tea but really any beverage would work.  I am very pleased with the quality.  Although they are a bit large, they wash superbly in the dishwasher and store nicely.  Even my husband who can't get excited about glasses loved them.  We have them displayed in our cabinets behind glass and they look great.  I think the value surpasses the price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I really liked this product at first.  I made a few pizza pies with it and it does definitely crisp the crust very quickly.  So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."

I am older and have a problem with night sweats, so I was looking for a memory foam pillow that would stay cool.  I have to say that I am a little disappointed.  I don't see much difference between this pillow and the pillow that I had, as far as being cooler. In addition this pillow is not as soft and flexible as my first one and I assume that is because of the gel.  If you toss and turn a lot like I do, or suffer from night sweats, this is probably not for you.  However, the price is very reasonable compared to others.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"It's an okay water pump for me but my wife doesn't really like it. The reason is when she presses the top it gets stuck and by the time she gets it unstuck, the pump has lost the vacuum pressure. She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of force required exceeds what she can apply sometimes.
I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.
Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer. Down to two stars."

I haven't had to remove them yet, however they are stuck to tile so I'm not sure how the removable feature works but so far they have held up in the humidity of my bathroom very well.

What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This Rice Cooker cannot be stopped! I've been using it for over a year and decided to write a review because of all the negative reviews here. For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability.

I had a similar model before and it seemed to be a great deal. The only thing I didn't like is that it came with a plastic bag for the door. I also had a 2 pack with a plastic bag and a plastic bag for the door. I also had a different model that had a plastic bag for the door.

I will update this review if I find any issues with it. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

4 stars."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Should have done this long ago. It replaced my Mr. Coffee electric chopper.  This unit fits nicely in my hands.  I like the sound of the beans being crunched in the mill.  Yes, it takes a while.  I haven't timed it.  It's not burdensome.  You can walk around while you grind.  The directions are in English.  A helpful hint is to hold the handle in place while adjusting the grind.  Counterclockwise for coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.  It's a fine piece of equipment.  The plastic top is such a good fit it's not easy to pry off.  That's OK!  No complaints!  I use this with my AeroPress.  Great combo.  Next I will try roasting my own."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I over all like Panasonic products a lot and have been happy with them. This rice cooker is, however, different. The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much or you do not give it time to evaporate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this poor design, it can cause a short circuit. Please note that not every time the water will drain down that far or it will drain into the socket head on, but for me it is too much a chance to take."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this food processor a little over 3 years ago and have been very happy with it the whole time.

About a week ago, I had a problem where it wasn't assembled properly and turned on anyway: it should not have been able to do this, it damaged itself and posed a safety hazard in doing so.  I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.

A company can't entirely prevent malfunctions.  This is the best customer service experience I have had in years.  I recommend KitchenAid products on the strength of this experience alone."

The only thing I wish was a bit more precise was to make the ice stick to the top of the mug.  I have a glass of orange juice and I have a mug that is about the size of my mug.  I like the idea that you can cut it down to a few ounces, but if you don't want to make ice, I would suggest cutting it down to just a few ounces.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

After all, I am happy with the pot for the price and the build quality. Not sure if I would pay extra $30+ for the fancy features Zojirushi brand offers."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The quality of this Mandoline is top notch. I would not consider anything less from a Borner product. I tend to over research everything I purchase and relied heavily on the interweb to provide some background since this is my first Mandoline.

I love the size and ergonomics of the product and the ease of storing, washing and handling. It has some nice features that make it ideal for its purpose. The interchanging size plates store easily with the product and the blades store in backwards for safety. I

It also has a nice locking mechanism to prevent the blades from exposure and unwanted cutting.

I recommend always cutting with the guard or at least some sort of safety glove. I have sliced everything from sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, fries, cucumbers, zucchini and pickles with ease.

I am very satisfied with the Mandoline and think you will be too."

I found the opening to be much smaller than anticipated.  I purchased this based on the reviews that it would cut a sweet potatoes.  I would not recommend this product if you looking to cut a sweet potatoe. The suction to keep it in place did not work and it was uncomfortably placed.  The sweet potatoes when I finally got it to cut went flying out of the contraption.  In the video you see the suction come back up so I have to hold it down.  Then you see how much pressure it takes me to get the sweet potato though and it never makes it the last little bit so everything go flying out over and into the sink.  Ugh."

Nice having two different thermometers to check different parts of the meat.  I use this for cooking in the oven.  I leave the timer outside and put the meat in with the thermometers and this works fine.  I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.

I keep one in my bike basket.  The item expands much larger than a plastic bag however.  These hold a lot of items, and a lot of weight.  Yes, if you have delicate items like breads mixed with canned goods, you'll likely squish the bread as the bag doesn't have the stability of a paper bag, so things shift when you grab the handles.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Initially bough this kettle for use downstairs in our wet bar while guests were visiting.

Now with all the guests gone, we've brought it upstairs to replace our rusting Kitchen Aid stove-top kettle.

I love how quickly it heats, even when full, and is super handy when I want to quickly heat small amounts of water.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.

Overall, good product."

It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

The problem is that plastics are so ubiquitous and cheap.  How do you replace them without - at the very least - going broke?

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.  Yes, my kid has to remember to bring them home.  But they don't break easily, and, because I can microwave in them, they save on dishwashing, too.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"This glass is just so beautiful. The design is just perfect. The lid is a nice touch. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very skinny and had her neck in a sling. The size is perfect for her. She loves it. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works great. I am very pleased with it. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid. I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working as I hoped. I got this to replace my old one I had."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I purchased this pan for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am using it for the first time in a 4x6 pan.  It is perfect for a small kitchen.  I love how it keeps the food warm and a bit cold for a short time.  I have made a batch of cookies and they are very cute.  I have not used it for any other type of cookie making, so I don't know how it will hold up.  I am very happy with it.  I have a larger pan, but it is perfect for my needs.  I would highly recommend it.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought this heater at Wally world for either $42 or $44 dollars. It is so much better than any cube (ceramic) heater I have ever owned. I have owned 5 ceramic heaters. I have only had this heater about 2 weeks and I am so pleased with it. I looked at these online because I remember having a quartz heater years ago (don't ask how many) and remember how nice it was. As far as durability, I can not answer that so I sprung for the extended warranty (2 years) for $3. I hope I don't have to use the warranty :-)= . It heats up quickly and is not loud. I use it in the bathroom that has been notoriously cold and the difference is like night and day. You will not go wrong with this one. It has considerable size to compared to the cubes, but it works so much better."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,These are great and work with the Neato D80. I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"I must say if I had known the quality of these I would have purchased them in person instead of ordering from Amazon. The quality of these is excellent, and the price is very reasonable.The lid is great.  The lid is very thick.  I use it to heat up the coffee.  I have a pot that I hang on the top of the stove top and the lid is just right.  I like the fact that it is so easy to clean and dry.  I have had no problems with the lid.  I am very pleased with this purchase.I'm a huge fan of the Nordic Kitchen that does a great job of making great quality soups for you and your guests.  They're also great for cold soups and hot sauces."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Worst product ever. It was a joke and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the cover is so small. The plastic part is also very thin and the cover is very flimsy. It is hard to get the cover to come apart. This was a gift and I would definitely recommend it.I have a few of these in the kitchen and they are a little rough. They are just not the most durable or nice looking. The color is very pale pink and not very vibrant. I had to take a chance and order a replacement, but I was happy with them.These are great, but the cotton is a bit soft, not too soft. I bought a different color and I like it better. I also like the color and the size."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Soup & Salads-from-scratch makers: THIS CHOPPER IS FOR YOU!  Just about every ingredient you'd use in soups/salads can be chopped in this machine.  No More stopping to sharpen knives, no more chopping boards at a height too high for your comfort, no more cuts to your hands and fingers.  Plus, simple to clean and sanitize.  Chopped pieces are relatively uniform in size, and can be chopped into large or smaller squares.  Here's a tip: The least-fatiguing way to use this is to place the machine on a table of lower height--for me, that is 26"".  From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.  The only feature missing is where to find replacement chopping screens.  Anyway, scoop this chopper up, you'll be very glad you did."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Edit: Next day, friends over for barbeque. Knives were the center of attention. These colorful tools made fast work of steaks, by cut right through whole filet, and prepared assorted melons in record time. Ordered second set over dinner!

After using my pocket knife to cut a canteloupe, I decided it was time to replace a couple of ancient Henkels knives. I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off. To my relief, the cutting edge is exposed stainless steel that will sharpen nicely. Promptly tried the unusually serrated utility knife to cut a melon; I had never seen a blade quite like the wavey edge on the utility and bread knives - fantastic!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The DGB-600BC was recently purchased because my previous unit was 8 years old and was starting to leak.  I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement through the years.  The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Saved a few $ by choosing the Amazon Warehouse Deals option and selecting a ""used like new.""  My mug was indeed brand new, maybe a return in which someone didn't like the color.  Personally, I love the Latte color and it is not as brown looking as in the picture but is just a tint darker than the natural stainless finish.  Most importantly this mug is all it is advertised as.  Keeps coffee hot all day, and with no worry of leaking.  It's also easy to clean.  If you want the finish and vacuum to hold up though you MUST hand wash the bottom container part.  The top is dishwasher safe though.  This is a really sturdy mug but if I ever need to replace it I'll be looking to buy another one, I'm also thinking these make for nice gifts for my coffee and tea drinking friends."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"My husband and I enjoy this set and the price is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This is a great value. The reviews said it was a great size, but it is not. It's not a very large towel. It's just a towel with a towel holder. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the material is very soft, but I'm sure it will last a very long time. I just wish the material was more absorbent. I have used it a couple of times, and it feels great. I'll buy another one to make my laundry easier. Very good quality. Very thin."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"A great little spice rack.  We installed ours behind a cabinet door and it works well.  We don't have matching spice canisters, but the majority of our spices are from Walmart & Aldi...and they fit just fine as they are.  It comes with 2 sets of screws.  One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!  Oh well!  The last screw went in perfectly fine and even with only 3 screws, the rack is solid and doesn't swing or move around when opening/closing the cabinet door.  Good little purchase to help organize the kitchen!  I would recommend this product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've been caught by the juicing bug, and I looked into which ones had the best performance. This one has been great, I've already made several gallons of juice from it in only a couple of days. It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Some people have complained that centrifugal juicers are bad at leafy greens, but I've done kale, spinach, and parsley, and I'm getting the amount of juice from them as I'd expect."

I'm not sure if this is a design flaw, but if it's a design flaw, I'm not sure it's worth paying for.  I'm not sure how much I would have paid for it, but I think it would have been better if it had been thicker.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased this travel mug at Target a year ago.  I loved it so much that I wanted another one. I didn't want to pay Target's price, so I went to Amazon.com and found it cheaper here - so I ordered it.  This is the one and only awesome travel mug of all kinds!  The coffee stays hot for hours, it is truely ""leak proof"" - and I just can't say enough good things about this mug.  I purchased other kinds that say they are leak proof, and they were - but my coffee was luke warm within 20 minutes in my car. The Thermos stainless steel leak proof mug keeps my coffee hot for a long time (about 3 hours - went to a meeting and left this on my desk - came back 2 1/2+ hours later - and my coffee was still hot!). This is a DEFINATE YES in my book!!!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was thinkinf about gettinf my carpet cleaned professionally until I caught this on sale. I figured, why not. I was disgusted at hiw filthy my carpet really was. I read in another review that it'll be best to first go over the carpet in the rinse mode to first loosen the dirt before switching over to the wash cycle. I probably changed rhe water 5 times before getting to wash bc this was pulling up so much gunk even though my carpet didn't even look bad! I found the accessories a pain at forst in regards to having to pull the water tubing part of the hose back out after I was finished. However, other than that, I am happy. This hoover does wonders and I love it. Will probably go back over my carpet weekly until the water tank comes out completely clear. Do small sections at a time. I was at it for hours in amazement."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love poached eggs.  Used to make them all the time until my old pan's handle rusted and fell off!  After that I tried to make them in a pan with vinegar, used microwave poachers, etc.. and finally just gave up. I was shopping for something else on Amazon and just happened to run into this pan advertised.  It seemed like a lot of $$ to poach eggs.  I read the reviews and ordered it.
Life is good!!  Haha. I now have my perfect 4 min. poached eggs again. Put a little water or butter in the cups and the eggs slide right out.  The pan is very useful for me.  I reheat food in it, make sauces, cook small quantities of anything.  Washes up easily! Cups wash right up.
I would definitely buy this again and what a fool for waiting sooooooo long to enjoy eggs the way I want them again!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,It hurts me to give this a 3 star because it is a nice piece of equipment but it is a very small piece of equipment.

I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style for him to use. I am very pleased with this product. I will be ordering another one for my 1 year old. I love these for our small apartment!Very nice and well made. I like that it is a little bigger than my other sheet. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not as thick as my previous sheets.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This rug is awesome. It is so comfortable and the quality is great. It was delivered on a stormy day and survived transport. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

SO HAPPY WITH THIS RUG!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These cups are huge and beautiful.  Unfortunately when I got my package, there was an ominous rattling in the box.  There is very little packing between the cups and apparently an impact had shattered one completely, shattered one's handle beyond repair and snapped another handle off which was able to be reattached with just a little gap missing. Only the blue cup survived.

Sadly, I really love the cup that survived, so I miss the ones that didn't make it.  The mugs are nice and big, perfect for serving desserts, soups or cereals out of.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality ceramic mug, but it is decent.  It seems homey and casual enough to use everyday, and survives the dishwasher fine.

I'm sure Amazon would replace any mugs destroyed in transit, but I with a little more care in packaging had been used to ensure that they would arrive intact.  Otherwise, they are beautiful."

The blades are nice and thick and the blades are not so thin as some of the blades we have been using. The blades are very thin and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with a heavy weight. The blades do not have a strong enough grip to make a great counterweight. I am not sure if this is a good design or if it is just a matter of how the blades are spaced. We have been using the blade for a while now and it is still holding up well.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased a set of the Hamton Stovetop spoon stand for dinning room. The stand is designed well. The stand and dishes are good weight and very stable.

I use these with my white/light colored serving and plates. Like it so much that I ordered another set for the kitchen counter.

I also own stainless spoon dish/stand set for over 10 years without any rust. That's one thing I can not yet rate because I haven't owned these long enough to know if they will rust or not.

Yes, it is cheap for the money, and because the parts are all plastic you must treat it delicately,
I used only a 12 oz bottle for starters. YOU MUST USE DISTILLED WATER so no mineral build up occurs.  Yes, put solid black tape over the bright blue light to fix that issue. Has Auto Shut Off when bottle is empty. Yes, cleaning to avoid mold build up is reasonable to do. I use white vinegar as a rinse.
Allow to air dry every week. Yes, the fan is not silent, but some people like ""white noise"". This is meant to be a ""personal"" unit, meaning small and portable, takes up very little space!

Maybe quality was an issue when they first came out, but it's 2018 and I've had mine for 3 years now. I bought it specifically because it has NO BLADE, thus it is TSA-approved! I can take it anywhere! I constantly find myself in the situation of having a bottle of wine and no opener. Sometimes when traveling across the country, sometimes just traveling across town. Instead of buying a corkscrew in another state only to have it thrown away when I get to the airport, I keep this blade-free gem in my purse at all times. I have LITERALLY gotten high-fives from TSA agents who stare in amazement that there is indeed NO BLADE on this baby!

The blower is at the bottom but so far I haven't had any problem with picking up dust and even feathers which get randomly get blown into my house.  The detachable cone is simple to undo and empty however on the down side, the filter is not that easy to clean.  Dust, especially if you try washing it, gets stuck between the crevices.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Extremely well packaged. Very thick outside box, then another inside box, thick cardboard protection top and bottom. On the small side but I knew that. Step for lid works very well and does not tip even when empty. Soft closing lid is nice also. Must use the plastic liner as the bottom is not solid but that is no issue for me since I wanted something that would not rust from my empty, but wet, contact lens packs. Update:  Been several months now and although it sounds foolish, this is one of my favorite items ever purchased on Amazon. The plastic liner is very simple to remove and dump and clean if needed. I do not feel a need to use a plastic bag. The lid opens and closes softly and smoothly each and every time. No need to keep your foot on the pedal to lower the lid."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this crock pot now for about 5 years and it still works just as good as the day I bought it. There is a timer which we've have used for up to 10hrs for simmering chilis. There are three heat settings for cooking: Low, High, and Warm. I really like how the lid snaps and secures to the crockpot itself. The lid and and insert casserole bowl are dish washer safe and I have put both on the bottom rack. I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews. My husband and I both work 12hr days so having a crockpot meal or two a week is a life saver. I definitely recommend this crockpot if you love a good hot ready to eat meal when you walk through the door at the end of hard day."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"The price is the key here. I bought these a month ago and finally got to use them. The bags are a little bit ""slipperier"" if that makes sense and the roll doesn't fit in the area meant for bags. I knew this prior to purchase.... but it is inconvenient to cut them by hand. I guess I will roll some out so they do fit. I would recommend though without question for the price alone!

*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold. I resealed at least 10 packages yesterday that I noticed had a gap/room inside. One package actually had freezer burn. So in the long run this item was DEFINITELY NOT worth it!"

I love the fact that I can use the preheated oven to heat up my pizza.  I have not used it for any other type of pizza, and I have not used it for other types of pizza.

I would definitely recommend this product. Love it. I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to be a complete mess. I wanted a great, functional, inexpensive, and strong metal dishwasher safe. I bought this for my son to use on his kitchen counter. He loves it, he loves it, and he loves it. I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others. This is a very good, good quality mattress. I have to say it's not the most comfortable mattress I've had in years."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,I received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love how cute they are! My kids are been choosing their molds for their eggs and pancakes every single morning. They really seem to enjoy choosing their shapes and eat all of their food. My kids needed that little extra push to get them to eat all of their food. The silicon molds are BPA-free and made of flexible yet durable 100% food grade silicone and can withstands temperatures of -20 F to 450 F. They do not stick to your food too much so it makes it really easy to separate your food from the mold. I still sprayed mine with coconut oil out of habit when I use them in the morning. It is very easy to clean and store as well. I keep them in a Ziploc in the drawer. I am sure you and your children will loves these as much as my children and I do.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"After searching many websites for vacuums I was more than confused.  Attempting to get reviews that I felt comfortable with led me to Amazon.  All I can say is that every positive review on here was correct.  This Dirt Devil packs a great punch for the money.  It is extremely light weight and versatile, the carrying strap makes it even more so.  It fits under furniture that my canister does not.  It is great for autos, steps, and bare floors, which is what i wanted; I use my canister for the wall to wall.  It is easy to empty the dirt container and because it is clear, it is easy to see when it is full. The cord is also long enough for me to do an entire room and with the strap attached, I just walk and vac.  My cleaning time has been cut in half with this unit and I highly recommend it to everyone."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.  I'm disappointed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"UPDATE: I believe this vacuum is now going on 4 years old and still works like a champ. Had to replace the filter twice in that timeframe, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Probably go on for another 4 years.

I'll keep it short:

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.  We did a side by side comparison of another upright vacuum, and this pulled more dirt and more pet hair out of the carpet than the other one.  Not by a little bit, but by a huge amount.  I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.

I hope this lasts 15 more years, because I never want to use another vacuum.

Oh, I did have to go out and buy a bristle brush attachment."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The first Bissell Pet Hair Remover purchase was for my mother's home.  There were 3 dogs (2 Great Danes and a 40 lb mutt), and 4 cats.  There is carpeting throughout most of the house, and on all 27 (sigh) stairs.  This thing got the stairs cleaner than I thought possible.  We've brought them back to looking brand new - not to mention the work it did on the furniture.  So, when I moved into a house with all hardwood floors but carpeted stairs (wait..what?), and two dogs...I knew what I had to do!  I have a Great Dane, and a Terrier style mutt.  Lots of blonde and white hair is attracted to those stairs.  This thing made them brand spanking new in minutes.  The suction is great - I am continually shocked that it is so powerful.  The front end tool is fantastic.  I can't say enough about this thing.  I highly recommend it!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I purchased a reconditioned Salton EX 122 about a month ago. I thought I'd be getting a great deal, since my previous experience with reconditioned / refurbished products has been uniformly good. Not so here. The coffee maker came missing several parts, including the espresso carafe and the metal filter basket. Foolishly, I decided that it wasn't worth returning the whole item to Amazon for these two small parts, but as it turned out, these two small parts were impossible to find online. I eventually managed a partial solution, but then I encountered a much bigger challenge (at least when it comes to enjoying a nice cappuccino). On other machines I've had, the steam pressure could be directed either toward the filter basket or into the milk frother. Not so here. The steam isn't emitted through the frothing tube until practically the end of the process. So, great espresso but crappy cappuccino because the milk never gets warm and never gets frothy.

The coffee maker works great, though."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,I ordered two sets = $24. 00 each. I will keep them for the next couple months. Great price!Works great.

I would not buy again. Great. I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break. I'm not sure how long it will hold up but it's a good size. It fits perfectly in my glass cabinet. I'll be ordering more. I'm using it for my daughter's room. Very nice for the price. Love it!Easy to clean.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm in a new house, and trying to keep to my resolutions of being organized. You know all those little things you have around the house? In the bathroom, the office, the kitchen? This, and the other sizes, are all great for corralling them up and keeping them from looking junky.

I'm using one of these to keep my diabetes equipment - testing, syringes, etc. Before, I kept them in an old tupperware, and they'd always get jumbled up in the bottom. Now my syringes are standing up, my oral meds are in a slot, and the whole thing slides neatly into a cabinet.

I've got one in my office, too, holding all the things that aren't pens - little styluses, nail files, computer screwdrivers, etc. In my bathroom, one's holding tweezers, manicure scissors and little samples of perfume in 1 cubby.

The nice thing is, even though I have 2 of them tucked into cabinets, they're good looking enough that I don't mind keeping them on a counter or desk."

I also like the fact that the blade is very easy to clean and that the blades are on a smooth surface. I love that they come with a tray for easy storage, but I really like that they come with a small trash can for storage, and that they have a magnet on one side for easy storage. I also like that the blades are larger than I thought. It also helps to keep my blades clean even if I accidentally scratch them."

It has a very nice height for the baby and it is pretty strong.  I like that the rubber parts are not too firm to get into the mold.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I purchased both the 10 inch queen and the 12 inch King mattresses. I am extremely impressed with both mattresses They were delivered on time and very nicely packed in a right sized box. The mattresses puffed up to full size in about 45 minutes with no odor. They feel magnificent, just the right amount of softness with solid support. We purchased the 10 inch queen for the guest room and after trying it out we immediately replaced our king with the 12 inch DreamFoam, it was that good. DreamFoam bedding has my highest recommendation. I really couldn't be more satisfied. Our previous mattress cost three times as much and wasn't nearly as comfortable. Buy this mattress, you won't regret it. Also, thank you for making good on the three day delivery right to my front door. I know this review sounds too good to be true. It has been a long time since I have been this happy with a purchase. Both mattresses really did exceed my expectations."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I must have been cooking pasta now for the past 20 years, and I have always boil the water in a big pot and cook it that way. I had no idea something like this even existed. Cooking with the microwave was a new concept for me, because I only used it to re-heat stuff.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

My only regret is not being exposed to this product years earlier. Highly recommended!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."

I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

There is enough clearance from the banana hanger so the bananas do not interfere with the fruit, and its a bonus that the basket itself is very deep. The fruit basket was just slightly bigger than I though it to be, but that's not really a problem for me. The brown is pretty dark, so if you are worried it will clash with other colors in your kitchen it won't. In my kitchen I have a lot of brown accents all over; at first glance it does look black, but after looking for a couple more seconds you see that it is in fact brown. Either way, you can't go wrong with this basket."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,Bought this for my Zojirushi (Coffee) and I'm very happy with the purchase. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use. The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small. This is why I ordered this for the price. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I think it is a good quality product. I just wish the lid was a little wider to hold more coffee. It's very easy to open and close the lid. You can see the coffee inside the lid and it's not just the coffee that's inside but the beans that are inside the lid. I can't say enough about how I like this product. I got a second one for my daughter to use when she's in her first year of college and she loves it. I have used it
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"It's all been said by some of the reviewers, and I'm not sure how well this one will hold up.  The plastic parts are thin and the plastic part is a bit flimsy.  I'll be getting a better one for a few years.  I'll also be getting a stainless steel one for a few years, but I don't think I'll be buying one of those.  This one is a little bit more expensive, but it's well worth the price.  I'd definitely recommend this product.I bought these for my daughter to use for her tea.  She loves them!  She said they look great in the dishwasher.  I am very happy with them and wish they were a little smaller.They are cute. Very thin, but very nice.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Ever bought lettuce or spinach and, after 3 days in the fridge, find that it's turning to a slimy mess?  Got concerns about E. coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens?

If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl. Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water. Agitate it with your (clean, recently washed) hands and let it sit for a few minutes. 2)  Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water. Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand. 3)  Lift the basket and pour out the water, then spin, spin spin. 4)  Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel. 5)  Put the basket back in, lock the spinner down, and store in the fridge. Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love my Healthy Human bottle! I have one. My husband has one. We have the metal pint glasses. It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"One reviewer said it is a little too wide, but I will admit that it is a pretty sturdy piece. I had to cut a bit to get the top to be a little tighter but it worked well. It was a breeze to assemble. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great stainless steel dishwasher. I did have to make sure the lid was a little longer than intended for my purposes, but I am happy with the finish. I like that the dishwasher does not come with a sink holder. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great dishwasher.I bought this to replace a old that was broken in the middle of the night.  It was fairly easy to clean and to assemble.

The screws are a little too loose, but it's okay. It's a little thin, but it's not too big. The reviews said it was a good quality, and it's a good quality. If you have a lot of screws, you will probably want to buy a different set.I love this pan. I have been using it for a month now and the pan has kept cooking, which is why I gave it 4 stars.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Not the best shoe storage container I've had, but it works. The fabric is a bit thin, and I feel that my heels will eventually poke through it. There isn't much support and mind definitely doesn't stand up stiff like the one shown in the picture. This would be perfect for child shoes, or for flats. Tennis shoes and heels do not fit together in one slot. They take up two because of how small the slots are. That being said, I put my expensive shoes in this container so that they don't get ruined or dirty by other things in my closet or by other shoes touching them. I keep it in my closet as it doesn't fit under the style bed frame I have, and it works wonderfully to keep them clean and organized. The zipper is strong, and the plastic top allows me to see what I have in the bag without having to open it and look through. I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"My mom and dad had a Big Ben just like this on their nightstand back in the 1960s. I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Both of these whisks are very accurate and the finish is good. The only reason I gave it four stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This is a very good product. I love it. I love the color, the size, the quality. It has great storage for my bags, and I love the fact that it is easy to clean. I have not used it yet, but I am sure I will. I'm very happy with it. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things. My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.  Finally, the steam valve inexplicably shattered one day, and judging from the other reviews here, this is not an uncommon occurrence."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"First of all, I did not have the time to try this out.  I would have given it a 5.5 stars but, considering that the box was advertised to be 4.5"" tall, it is not.  I was expecting it to be 4"" tall but, with the height of the bathroom, the width of the shower is right on the mark.  I will say that I had to use a different size shower curtain to fit it.  I am very pleased with this product.  I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.  I am very pleased with this shower curtain.  I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  I have used it several times with my mattress, and I never found any cracks"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great little tray for just about anything you'd want to use it for. I use mine in my medicine cabinet to organize my plethora of travel size soaps and sample products until I am ready to use them. I would also aggregator office supplies like post it's, binder clips and other similar items. It's made from clear plastic and has nice smooth edges and a very level bottom. The sides have a low profile that  make it easy to access items even if on a shelf. I have found its a great nail polish caddy, and for makeup items and since it fits perfectly in my bathroom drawer I will be purchasing another one or two.

Due to the size of the three compartments, its not the best for skinny items that tend to tip over, like gloss, mascara or brushes. It looks now certain enough to use on the counter, but isn't quite big enough to efficiently store perfume bottles.

Overall I like it and would make interdesign my new go-to brand for caddies."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open. I can sleep comfortably on my side or back. it comes with a cloth bag for storage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I had my doubts about this product but when I started using it I realized there are a lot of possibilities to use this. It's stainless steel so it will match any kitchen decor. It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

I'm really happy with this pan.  I'm very happy with the quality of the pan, but I really don't want to spend the extra money on a pan that will rust.  This pan is a great pan.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I love not having to store and pull out a large machine to vacuum seal leftovers now.  I've used it for all kinds of things and I'm really enjoying how little space it takes up in my drawer (along with the charger).  I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something or many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.  We have a super tiny kitchen so I cannot leave the charger out all the time.  An indication of when I need to charge it would definitely change my rating to 5/5."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"When I'm seriously tired, this coffee machine infuriates me. Because if I""m tired I forget how particular it is about how you line up the basket. Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

I did have some issues with the opening on the back of the legs, but I will keep it that way. The metal is very sturdy, and I am very pleased with this product. It is very heavy, and does not move around. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a long wooden leg. I love the concept. It makes a great cup of coffee for my family.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming for the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away! So far I estimate that he has thrown away 1/4 waffle for every 6 waffles he has made...so the batter won't make as many as before. still looking for the appropriate measure). It's heavy duty & hope it lasts for years!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes."

It does hold a lot of stuff and it is easy to clean. I'm very happy with this purchase. These are great. I love that they are made of fiberglass. I am really happy with this purchase.

It has a smooth surface, a small size ridge maker, & a large size ridge maker. This would be great for cutting potatoes into ridged potato chips.
  You use firm veggies to work best in the spiralizer. I used potatoes to make a mashed potato dish; carrots, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes to make a veggie stir fry; and also made a spiralizer veggie salad with pasta and Italian dressing. They were all fantastic additions to my meals. This spiralizer also comes with a free recipe book to help you on your way to eating healthier.

It comes with a lightweight wood tray, which can either be used with the tealights, or with something else. Their are 9 tealight holders, in the set, of varying heights, colors and textures. The great thing is, since there are 9 tealight holders, you could actually break them up and use some in other areas too. Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light. If you have a bathroom with a tub, by they window, they would be great on the window ledge, where they would catch the light, during the day, and could be used for ambiance, when taking a bath."

I'm suffering from a minor sciatica pain and I had hoped that a chair like this that would relieve lymphatic vessels around hips would help.  But this one did not.  I couldn't find a comfortable position.  After only using it for a few hours, my shins were slightly bruised! (Purple veins were apparent)  I tried not to put too much weight on the knees/shins, but then my pelvic bones were in pain like I was on a bicycle for hours.  So I would put my weight back on my knees/shins, but then I would have pain in my shin - not so much in the knees.  I decided I couldn't work like this for 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."

One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This cookie sheet is a thin silicone membrane with a silicone covered metal frame and handles that is oven safe to 400 The baking surface dimension is not a perfect rectangle; the width of the edges measure 10 1/2 wide, the center 11. I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve.
When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.  I will use it more as specialty equipment for baking something very sticky like Florentines but continue to use my traditional cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper for most of my baking."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,I bought this radio from a local electric company and it was a nice piece of equipment.  It is so quiet and easy to operate.  The remote is easy to set up and the button to select the AM/PM is easy to use.  This is a great product for the price.  I have a portable radio and I can't wait to use it for my own use.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"

That being said, I like this appliance for what it is, an electric pressure cooker. I found myself like most folks on here, not sure of how to use it, as the 'cookbook' that came with it was pretty much just a few recipes. I did find a wonderful pressure cooker cookbook here on Amazon, and I would suggest you purchase something along these lines. This author has been using electric pressure cooking for years, and her book is full of helpful hints, and tons of recipes. I have found it to be invaluable. Just even in the rice section. I was at a loss with the instructions that came with, but in this book, it's all perfectly laid out. The book is available here on Amazon 'hip pressure cooking'.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it."

If the lid is not secured properly it will not start (nice feature)!  Lots of power = lots of noise...this has both.  Also, this lower blade is integrated into the pitcher, unlike the other models that screw into the bottom of the pitcher and eventually leak.
Suction cups on the bottom really stick this blender into the counter keeping it from moving...nice touch!

So why not five stars????

Not only does this blender not work with any of the Ninja single blending cup accessories it is not advertised as such.
A call to Ninja confirmed this.
Would be nice if I could use the Ninja single serve blending cups.  The single serve cups allows you to store several days worth of your blended batch into these cups.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.

I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected."

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."

the hardest step was step four

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out.

As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels."

They are great, and I don't think they will be a problem for most people.  I use them to provide a quick and easy way to pour water into the pitcher, and I have not had a problem with the pitcher being damaged or broken.  I do think that they will be useful for making very small amounts of coffee, but I don't think they are too big, and I haven't had any problems with them breaking.  They are definitely a good value, but I don't know how much they cost.  I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a quick way to pour water into a pitcher.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am obsessed with mason jars. As someone that cans, I always have mason jars on hand. I use them for everything possible. I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

I received this product for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review. This is my unbiased, honest opinion of this product."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.

What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.

A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.

This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I got a great deal when I ordered this item. In return, I'm making my honest and very reliable information about this queen bed sheet bedding set.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft and made with best quality materials. The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS! I was anxious when I threw this Nestl Bedding Set to the washer, thinking it will shrink, pill and wrinkle like my other sheets. But to my surprise, i was wrong! I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets. This is way better than my other microfiber sheets. VERY SOFT, COMFORTABLE AND MOST OF ALL VERY EASY TO CARE.

I'm so pleased and so as my husband."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This was a two day project to put together.  We stopped the first night after an hour or so when we saw how slow it was going to come together.  My husband had to make holes larger in the metal parts in certain places because it wouldn't go together otherwise.  We sweated it out, and it was a pretty unpleasant experience.  Generally my hubby can make ANYTHING work, and he did with this, but lets just say you better start off as a happy couple beforehand because this thing was a b*tch.  Now that it's all done, sitting sturdily, I might add, in our entryway, we're thrilled.  We really like how it looks, the two of us can sit on it at the same time, we hang everything up there, leashes, coats, basket of bandannas on the top shelf, shoes on the bottom, sunglasses up top, you name it.  Very handy.  I think it was like 20 bucks cheaper the week after we bought it, but I wasn't too upset because it is a nice quality piece.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was looking to add variety to my breakfast with egg, ham and English muffin sandwiches. I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a poorly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings for the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked for the link so she could order a set."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I cannot say enough to warn you away from this pillow - please save your money.

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it work (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it work.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comfortable for your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your side (me)
So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

Now we have this pillow no one likes, even our house guests have tried it and preferred other, older pillows to this one!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Thank you, Sunbeam for a great product!  It's not even technically winter yet, and we've already had bitter cold temperatures and lots of snow in northern NY.  We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.  Other than that, it's a great product!"

His allergies were so bad last week he woke up short of breath and couldn't sleep. I let this run on high for 6 hours the first day, then switched it to medium the first night. I turn it off when we wake up and switch it on an hour or two before bedtime. My husband has been able to sleep through the night and wakes up rested. He is also much less congested so his snoring has reduced which was a huge bonus for me. The meduim setting may take getting use to for some. I have a white noise sleep machine (to block out the snoring) and it is a little louder than that. It doesnt bother us but we are use to it. The quiet setting is even quieter than my sleep machine. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that suffers from pet allergies and doesnt want to have to shave or give up thier beloved pets.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.  In short I would say that these are high quality knives, and for the price point, a solid investment."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"This review could get better, but I thought it would be better to make a small review about the other two.  The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.

My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"We bought this steam vac for my mother-in-law since my husband broke her other hoover steam vac. We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use."

The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use. I did NOT receive any type of promotional discount in exchange for this review. All statements made in this review in regard to this product, represent my own genuine and honest opinions."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and works OK. It also has a magnetic ball marker that slides off when you press the bottom of it (it has a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with team logos or other options offered by the manufacturer). The top end features an indent to hold a club, just above the magnet designed to catch bottle caps pulled off by the bottle opener (flip it over to use as a can opener). The 6th use of this is to hold cigars, something I would not use myself but which I suppose some golfers may have use for. This tool is nice to have and it is solid, so it should offer many years of use as long as you don't lose it. The shiny gold finish may not last, but while it does it will make the tool stand out in the green. One thing I do suggest is that Amazon place this in the sporting category rather than home goods, where it is currently listed. While it opens bottles and cans, the main purpose is divot repair, which people would search for in sporting goods."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products."

These have a strong tendency to get stuck in the dishwasher, and they're not very attractive to take out of the dishwasher. It's a shame, as it's not very sturdy. The packaging is a bit too small for what I wanted them for, but the containers are a solid quality. I just wish there was a way to label them. I don't know if this will help with the storage of my other jars, but I really like these containers. They're a very good value, and I'm very happy with the purchase.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"I got this because the office I work in is notoriously cold, and I thought it would help to keep my feet warm as cold feet was my biggest complaint while at work and that, in turn, made the rest of me cold.

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

As far as heat,  The output isn't great, but after having your feet on it for about half an hour, you will notice a difference.

For the price paid, I expected more. Very disappointing. I would not purchase this item until improvements are made with the sliding issue."

They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These shouldn't even be a question whether to buy or not. If you get the Harman Kardon HKTS 14 or 8 speakers, get these stands. You won't regret it!!! Unless, of course you are hanging your speakers on the wall. I liked these because they not only lift to perfect height but look so impressive too. I bought two Harman Kardon stereo setups for my house, a AVR 240 and the CP 15 with the AVR 135. I bought four sets of stands because I don't want to mount speakers to wall and these do the trick perfectly. They are very well constructed and the base at floor is heavy enough that you won't worry about them getting knocked over too easily. The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven. They come with rubber feet so they won't scratch my wood floors and if you have carpet, they also come with little spikey type of nails to help them stay put. They are easy to put together that each pair only took 5 minutes to complete. Harman Kardon really does make a quality product both in the receivers and speakers and these speaker stands are no exception."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This product is made of great quality.
The ice bowl is made of a heavy plastic and is great. The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl or any flaws that I could see. I was a little worried that it would leak but it does not and works very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled.
The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part.
So not only is this a great functioning product, but this works very well and looks elegant! I have had many compliments on this serving dish and I have referred many people to this bowl, I am over all satisfied with this product and this is just great and I couldn't be happier with this product.

I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING...

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks for doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.

There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edges of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.

This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.

This is a great whisk for smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably for many years."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'll be honest, when I first saw the picture of these gloves, my husband and I shared a great laugh, as they looked so silly! But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.

This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my wife and she is thrilled with it. It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what the problem is with the ""raw"" materials, but I don't think they really work.  I would definitely buy another set, but I'm not sure if they'll work well for my purposes.  I was very disappointed"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comfortable travel pillows Ive ever used.

WHAT IT IS:

- A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck for support with the optional benefit of heat.

WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:

- Memory foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The memory-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comfort and support. Extremely comfortable/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds more support.

- There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit for those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.

I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when working at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The memory foam and plush cover make this pillow comfortable to use for longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need for heat.  Heat or no heat, the THERMATECK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is wonderful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,CG,"Love, love, love. As some reviewers have mentioned, the finish is a bit on the thin side, and the bottom is not very smooth. The bottom is also slightly sticky, so it is not a big deal. The outside is a bit rough. I was worried it would be rough, but it's not. I will probably get a different color and finish. I love this product. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to clean, and I don't have to worry about the coffee getting stuck in the bottom of my cup, or anything. I've found that it is a bit difficult to clean because of the plastic coating. I'll be returning it. The color is true to the picture. It's not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as bad as I expected. I love it. Works great. Easy to use. I used this for a few days and I am very happy with the results.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Finally, after buying many coffee makers, I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's not.  I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right, it won't work.  I am very pleased with the quality of the coffee maker.  I have used it with a variety of things including hot water and a coffee maker that has a traditional style style top.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very good quality coffee maker.

The other coffee maker I've used, which I haven't had a chance to try yet, is the K-cup Coffee Maker, which is not as big as the K-cup maker I have now.  The K-cup coffee maker is much more compact, it is much more accurate and easier to operate.  I have no complaints about this.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."

This coffee maker is a great value. I have a Norpro coffee maker that uses a larger size coffee maker, so I would highly recommend this one. I have a Norpro Cuisinart Cuisinart Coffee Maker, but I can't find another coffee maker that I can buy this at a reasonable price. It is a great coffee maker and I would highly recommend it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.
-The word automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirror right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

All in all, this is cute and decent for the price!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site."

I love the fact that the bowls have a handle that doesn't slide off the bottom of the bowl. This allows you to just pour coffee or tea into the bowl with ease.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop."

Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"It looks very nice, but it has the design flaws. I will keep my old one but the other is so small that it's not worth the extra money.I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect size for my needs.  I love the sleek design and it's easy to clean and it also holds a large amount of coffee.  I also like the height of the blades and it's easy to hold.  I will buy another for my kitchen and to organize my collection.Very good.  I love that it has a ""stiff"" edge to it and that it is adjustable so you can adjust it.  It is a good size for my needs and looks nice in my living room.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a great quality product.I have a small kitchen with a lot of space in it. I wanted a little bit more space to store things in and this is perfect for that. I bought a small set and the size of the cabinet is just right. It's perfect for my purposes.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price."

The kettle is very easy to set up and does not require a lot of effort. I am very pleased with the quality of the product. The machine works well.

I have used it for the past year, and I am very pleased with the results.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what the problem is with the ""raw"" materials, but I don't think they really work.  I would definitely buy another set, but I'm not sure if they'll work well for my purposes.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

I have one toaster oven, and I like it so much I bought two sets of these toaster ovens.  I have a pizza pan and a pizza stick, and these are perfect for that.  I also like that they come with a small hook that you can use to attach to the bottom of the pan.  I like that the cooking time of the oven is very quick, and it's so easy to clean.  The cooking time of the oven is a little shorter than other ovens I've used, but it's a great product. "
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review. I purchased the blue, and found it to be a lovely and soothing hue very much like the one pictured. I'm glad I tried it,  and I like it! It could use a better presentation, but the product turned out to be great!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is the best invention ever!  I was always afraid of pressure cookers because of the noises that came from the ones used by my parents when I was a kid. I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking for a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.  Curious, I purchased this one and now I'm hooked.  There are 4 appliances in my kitchen that I cannot live without: my Zojirushi rice cooker, Nuwave oven, Nutribullet, and my Instant Pot!  If any one of these wore out I'd just turn around and immediately order another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.  Mmmmm good!  There are so many recipes available and tons of Youtube videos for cooking ideas.  Get one - have fun, and enjoy delicious food in a little time."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

I love that it has a built-in fan and it makes it easy to use.  The only negative thing I have is that it is a little too large for my small kitchen.  I can't think of a reason for that.  I was hoping it would be the size of my small kitchen but I'm glad I didn't.  I'm not sure if that's because of the large size but the size is just too small for my small kitchen.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are exactly what I was looking for!
They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

I ordered two for my sister and they both love it!They are a great size and well made.These are great. I just put them on my countertop and put them on the counter top of my coffee maker.  They are exactly what I wanted.  I use them to keep my coffee hot for a few hours or so and they work great.  I have been using them for a few months now and I am still using them to make my coffee.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I clearly received a different color than the one in the product image. The product is described as and pictured as *black with gold"", but I received blue with gold. and it's still lovely. I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I was worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black vs blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more settings without concern. But apart from that, I love it. It's very regal. I feel like I should invite the Queen over for a spot of tea. ---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of candid and objective review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.  All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived."

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

The Chico-Bags finally fixed the problem of leaving them at home -- leaving them in the car -- having too many or not enough....

since each bag wads up into a little light-weight ball of nothing -- and has a clip -- I just clip one to my bag and leave it there all the time.  I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I'd checked other options since last summer, and have acquired enough 2 liter seltzer bottles to start a bottle tower garden.
Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"I recently bought a used one of these and it is a great product!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic is sturdy and it is easy to clean.  It does not have a vacuum hose.  This is a great product for the money.  I have a few of them in the house and they are a little heavier than I expected.  This one is a little heavier and heavier too.  It is very easy to clean and holds a lot of stuff.  I would highly recommend this product.

I have a few other products that are better quality.  These are probably the best quality that I have found.  I like that they are a bit small for my daughter's room.  I also like that they are a little easier to fit into the cabinet than my old ones.  I also like that they are very well made.  I would highly recommend this product.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"My sons room is done in an alligator theme, and even though this is a dinosaur, it fits right in! I was so excited when I saw this, it's just so charming and fun for kids.

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."

I do not think it will be long before I need a king size bed. I would highly recommend this product. I really love these. I put them in a refrigerator and it's just like baking. The baking time is not as slow as I wanted it to be. I got a second one for my daughter to use when she's in her first year. It's a great product. Love the design of this pan. We use it on our sink and it's really easy to clean. It is a little pricey for a single pan, but it is a great product for the price. I love that it has a removable lid so you can keep your fingers from scratching the pan. It is a little bit pricey for something that we purchased at the grocery store. I also like that it is dishwasher safe."

Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef! I have not yet used the peelers (I have my ""go to"" potato peeler I will not cheat on). This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"this coffee maker is great for families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.
OVERALL, GREAT VALUE FOR THE MACHINE...GREAT LOOK, GREAT FILTERS, GREAT CAPABILITIES! 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE LEAK ISSSUE THAT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK TO GET OVER..AND ALSO SIZE. OTHERWISE, PERFORMANCE DESERVES 5 STARS!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Something I never expected when I bought it. I was expecting a lot of the same stuff. The top is a nice, solid piece of wood and the cover is very sturdy. It is hard to get the carpet out of the car if you don't have a lot of room. I have a few of them in the house and they are a little rough. I just put them on the floor and it is nice and smooth. I would not have given it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that the cover is not quite as thick as the carpet. I am happy with it and am happy with the price. It is a very good product for the price. The only negative is that I can't find a box of these for the price. I have only used them once so far and they are very good quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Very nice looking. I have not used it yet but I will update when I do. I got this for my daughter's first birthday party. She loves it!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I am surprised at some of the reviews that consider this a small chair.  Although it doesn't feel like a 17th-century King's throne, and although it is recommended to not be used by anyone over 225 lbs, my 6'3"" 200+ lb frame fits into this chair quite comfortable, with space on either side.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.  For now, a solid 4 stars for a major upgrade over my last office chair!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Looked at the top 4 brands of these: Wagon, Koolatron, Cooluli,and Igloo. Didn't necessarily ever need warm and didn't want to wait 5 weeks for delivery so that eliminated one. Then after looking at reviews bought Coleman and Igloo to compare and a generic converter (Shumacher 6v) since it looked like they didn't come with any. (Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons:
1. Cord came off the unit completely as shown in photo
2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf
3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best
4. Shelf

Loaded cooler the day before travel to save time morning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: Forgot the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.

Awesome item. Saves time, money, food, and don't know why I never got one before! Simple.  No loading ice every day and repacking the cooler."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.

bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

I'm not sure if the metal handles hold up well to hot water, but it is a nice quality product. I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update: After several months of use, I have noticed that the handles are too short. I would recommend that you buy the other brand and get a longer handle.

I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.  Real butter is okay and a little goes a long way!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"In the six months since, I have only used it once.  It is a little noisy.  If you want to get a solid immersion in the water, you have to go to the bathroom.

It is very soft.  I have had no problems with the color.  I love that it is made of fiberglass.  I am very happy with this purchase.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.I have been using this product for about 4 months now and it is doing the job.  It is not heavy, it is easy to install and I can use it on my bed.  It is very sturdy and doesn't slip around.  I love it and it is a great value.  I would highly recommend this"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

This was a replacement for a standard suction cup. I did not need a suction cup.

I had to replace a couple of the basic ones, but it worked fine.

The only thing I would change is that it was a little bit too large for my machine. I found it was a bit too small for the machine and it would not fit on the standard suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be ordering more!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Wow!! It took a while to assemble, but it worked out great. I just put the wood in a 6 inch circle and the wood was firm and the plastic was solid. I used this to make a little decorative plates for a gift for my grandpa and he loves it. The wood is a bit rough but I think it will be fine. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to remove the metal from the wood rather than sliding it around on the surface of the wood. I would have liked to have a better feel for the wood.These are great, but the cotton is really bad.  I've used them for a few weeks, and I still have the cotton, but I've had no problems with them.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

Once, the rest of the family saw it everyone wanted to measure 'stuff' to see how it worked.  Besides the refrigerator it is now our most used appliance in our kitchen.  My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."

I am very happy with the purchase!This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise. This fan is very quiet and does not have a fan noise. I will keep buying from Amazon. com again. I've had this for about a year now and I love it!  The color is vibrant and the very first time I used it I felt it was going to be too dark for me. I put it in a refrigerator and it's just like the picture but it's not too bright. It's just ok. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great pillow for a few bucks or more.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

The other two pieces are for the most part interchangeable, but if you are a fan of metal, this is a great piece.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love this!  Let me share the best two recipes ive found to make, the first one makes a 2 lbs loaf and the whole wheat a 1.5 one.
French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

both these use oil which i find much easier that cutting up butter and no dry milk or molasses needed or other ingredients I might not have on hand needed."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,CG,"Did about a full week, it was still very comfortable.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not really a problem. If you're going to use it for a lot of things, it's a good size for them.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the cord when opening the bag, it's a little too small for my small hands. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to it's use. I haven't used it at all. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to the use of my large hands.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum for the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped working as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers."

It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

I love that it is made of glass.  It has a nice metal handle that is easy to clean.  I have not had any issues with it.I have been using this to keep my coffee hot for hours. It's awesome! It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my taste, but that's not really a problem. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong.Love it!I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is very lightweight and doesn't have the bulky look of a rug. It's also made of a durable material. The colors are a little darker than the picture but still look great. I'm sure you'll love it.I received this item as a gift.  The quality is good. "

Around Christmas time we were expecting guests... I pulled out my vacuum and nothing. Sometime in the last few months of neglect it had expired. RIP... I still had guests coming. I live in the middle of national forest. Think, Big trees, bears, dirt, dirt and more dirt. Naturally I didn't have the time to drive the 140+ miles round trip to go to a town that has a stop light and a walmart. So what did I do I went to our local (only 30 miles away) hardware store. They carry two vacuums, not a lot of choice, but apparently there is a reason they only carry two. They work!  The Eureka was the more expensive of the two by about $20.00 But I liked the rewinding cord feature so I got it and went along home. Put it together and started vacuuming the cabin, let me tell you, it was amazing. Carpet that I had been thinking of replacing took on new life, the attachments were easy to use. Of all the silly things I was having FUN vacuuming. No really, it's true. BUT THE BEST PART was how it handled the dog hair in my home. I have two large golden retrievers, They are serious about their shedding. I truly believe that they think it's a career opportunity. They take it that seriously. This thing sucked it up along the base boards, under the beds off of the log walls and out of the couch cushions and not once did it clog up. I wish it had another attachment extension but other than that it's a well designed machine. My only other suggestion for improvement would be to come out with a ride-um-model with a cup holder."

I have been using this OXO for about a year now and it has not moved. It is very easy to use and I can use it on my OXO. I just put the OXO in my microwave. I have a hard time cleaning it because it is so dirty. I would recommend this OXO for anyone who needs to clean a microwave or microwave oven. I have used it on a couple of my other OXO's and I like it so much I bought another one for my family. It is also a good quality. I am very happy with this purchase. Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It was a little stiff but that's how it was intended to be. She loved it!  I'll definitely buy it again. Nice, thick, easy to clean, and I like that it holds a lot of items. I have a ton of items in this bag, and I have a lot of items in the freezer. These bags are very convenient and easy to clean. I bought 2 sets of these bags, one for my son and one for my daughter."

Overall This is a good product. I got the orange one for my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture for the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

I did not want the old one to become a new one. I wanted a different set of glasses. I decided to get this one because I love the quality of it. I would not recommend it to anyone.

I can tell you I am very pleased with the quality and the price. I have used them for about a month now and still love them!  I have not tried the rustic ones. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and the only thing I have not tried is the handle. I don't like it when I have to lift the cloth up to hang it and it would fall off the cloth.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I literally use this blender every day. It has replaced most all of my kitchen appliances!

We have no problems with chunky smoothies on the 1st try. We put carrot chunks, frozen spinach, giant chunks of frozen raspberries and they liquefy no problem. My toddler drinks her smoothies thru a sippy cup! I love that I can add fruits and veggies and even avocado for extra nutrition and they slurp it right up!

It chops nuts and veggies for easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide for most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes more, but requires a bit more volume to work correctly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies or batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."

I think the quality of this is just great.  I highly recommend it!I am returning this product. I have been using it for a month now and the only difference is that the handle is now a bit harder to use and the handle is a little more flexible.

I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it for a month and it still works well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now more likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it for a month and it still works well.  I had to return it because of that.

It's still a nice liner and a good value.Very nice."

I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a good down pillow at a great price. I bought my first down pillow over 10 years ago after a lot of testing. No, it wasn't this one -- but it also was three times the price of this one.

When we got our Tempurpedic bed, I switched to the Tempurpedic pillow for a couple of years. But I wasn't able to lay on my side as much because I couldn't breathe as well. So I kept my eyes open for a good lower-priced down pillow.

I stayed at several Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn hotels that featured the Touch-of-Down pillow sets. Several times this pillow stuck out as my favorite. On one trip I wrote down the details to check into it later. But I couldn't wait so I ordered it while I was at the hotel.

I'm liking it. For an across-the-board comparison it would only get 4 stars compared to my earlier 5 star down pillow. But at one-third the price, it's a 5 star in its own right.

It is basically a pillow within a pillow, but only occasionally can I tell that. The inner section gives a little more support, but I don't know that I need it myself.

The only downside was that I had to buy the protective cover separately -- on my earlier more expensive down pillow it came stock with the pillow -- which was probably another reason it was more expensive.

If you really want to try out some pillows (down, synthetic, and mixed) try one of the Hilton hotels with the Touch-of-Down program. My visits have been on business trips, but they could be romantic nights out or any other reason. It's kinda like renting a car to try it before actually forking over the money -- a worthwhile expense."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it works despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version.

I bought 2 sets of this for her room and I love them. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"We got this to match my old Teflon stove set.  This is the first one we've had.  The plastic is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this to make a little homemade bread.  We used it for making homemade bread for two people.  We used it as a quick and easy way to make homemade bread for several people.  We made a lot of homemade bread and it was pretty easy.  I like that the bread is thick and it holds a lot of flour, so it's easy to make for our dinner guests.  We also used it to make a pasta dish for two people.  This is a very handy feature.  I like that it's a small and easy to carry to the counter to store for later use.  I also like that the bag holds a lot of flour so you don't have to worry about it spilling out the bag.  I also like that it doesn't come with a lid.  It's a little awkward to use but it works great for our needs.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"So I've had my Wagner Steamer for 2 days and I am wondering how I ever lived without it. It is amazing. I have parrots and it has made cleaning their cages a snap with no harsh chemicals. I also have about 1,200 sq. ft. of tile on my first floor (cream grout--what was I thinking). It have cleaned the grout to almost new. It also took out a stain in my carpet that the carpet cleaners were even unable to remove....woo hoo...now I have this lovely clean spot in my carpet in the middle of the hallway..LOL. It has cleaned everything I've put it to (candle wax out of cloth, grease out of stove vents, gum out of particle board). The only thing it didn't remove completely was red paint from my son's jeans--well I had to try. I can't wait to try it on removing wallpaper.

Regarding the cons I have read:
Noise Level: if noise bothers you invest in some good ear plugs. It didn't bother me at all though and I've been a steaming maniac for oh almost 24 hours total.
Doesn't work like promised: Well if you expect perfection you will always be disappointed I am afraid. I have not been disappointed one bit in mine.

Recommendations:
Buy yourself a good pair of knee pads--you will need them.
Buy extra nozzles. If you are going to use yours as much as I am using mine you will need the extra nylon nozzles. I've already worn one of the nozzles down half way...yes I've been using my machine A LOT!!

Pros:
What can I say...you would be nuts not to get one. That is if it is something that you think you will use on a weekly basis. If not buy one for a good friend that you know will use it all the time as a Christmas or birthday present and borrow it...LOL."

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made.

I like the size of the top, but I like the size of the bottom.  It's very easy to store, and I don't want to mess up the counter top.  I also like the fact that it has a little lid.  I do like that it doesn't have a screw lid on the bottom, but it's a bit of a hassle to get to the bottom if you want to store it.  I don't have to worry about the metal going up.  I also like that the lid is not too big.  I also like the fact that the bottom has a plastic lid on the top.  The lid is about the size of a large cookie sheet, and it's very easy to store.  I'm very happy with the size of this, and I have a lot of compliments on it.  I have a nice collection of cookies, and I love how it's a little smaller than the cookie sheet.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it's not a quality product.This is a nice looking set of 5 pillows.  They are beautiful and I love them.  I put them in my shower and"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,CG,"""Let the buyer beware""  Not an easy task to put together.  There is a strong tendency to slide down the sides of the frame.  The frame itself is sturdy and strong.  I have had no issues with it falling over.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy frame.  I highly recommend it.I had to order one to replace the one I had for my grandson.  I love the color and the size.  It's very easy to wash and holds a lot of food.  I would highly recommend it.  I was just looking for a nice lunch table for my grandson.  It fits perfectly in my bathroom and he is very happy with it.I'm a huge fan of the color and the quality.  I've had a few of these and they work great.  I have no complaints about this.  They look great on my sink and the color is just right.  They are easy to put together and I am very happy with them.  I'm happy with the color though.  I don't like that they are so small so I can't fit a large mug of coffee in them.  I'll probably have to order more of these to have a nice look on my sink.  I don't know if it will work in my bathroom but I'm sure I'll have a nice mug of coffee by the time I get home.  I love the color and feel of these and would definitely buy them again.  I'm giving them five stars because they're very good quality"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Got these as a housewarming gift for a best friend who had moved into a house with 1 picture window and 3 oversized side windows.  These were such a deal (set of 2 panels) and was a neutral color that she had requested.  Okkkkk, let me say that the picture DOES NOT do these drapes justice.  They feel thicker and my hands kept caressing them; and the color is prettier in person that will compliment any primary color(s) you choose for your furniture and decor (FYI: the grommets are silver).  Not a true blackout but you definitely can't see through them.  My best friend ABSOLUTELY LOVED how they looked once we hung them up.

We got three - 1/2 in. x 10 ft. steel conduit pipes (approx. $3.00 ea.), which I used a Dremel to cut down to size and two - 1/2 in. Electrical Metallic Tube (EMT) Set-Screw Connectors (pack of 5) to use as dowels and to keep the pipes from sliding off of the brackets for a total of $30.96 (total cost for all 4 windows) .  A decent heavy duty curtain rod will cost at least $20.00 for one window (not including the curtain rod bracket).
P.S.:  The curtain rod idea is just a FYI DIY for those looking to save a money and need a heavy duty curtain rod.  I use conduit pipes and copper (L) pipes as curtains rods for curtains with grommets throughout my house.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"Ok so the product is not an easy to use product but it works for me.Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it, it keeps things organized and not too big for small items like my baby clothes.  I use it to hold my school supplies and clothes for my daughter's room.  I have used it a lot and it is perfect.  I would definitely recommend this product.Very nice to have. It is thin and thin but I think it will be a good quality product. It is very sturdy and sturdy too.I bought this to help me figure out how to use the V6V electric kettle.  It works great.  It is very quiet and the only thing I don't like is that it does not have a battery.  I find that this is a very small kettle, but I do like that it is very easy to store and that it is not a huge amount of water.  It also has a nice and small feature.  The battery is very convenient and easy to use.  I like that it is small, but that is not a big deal.  It is very quiet and it has a very good battery life.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I wanted to try this vacuum out in my home and I find it okay but nothing to brag about. Suction appears good and it picked up everything we threw at it, including pet hair, sand, dirt and dust just fine.  This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air for us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile floors however and I would certainly recommend it for that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,CG,"My Kitchen Aid went south, and it was time to try something else.

The first one we bought was the Eureka, which is the cheaper model, but it is much better quality.

The second one we bought was the Nordic, which is the cheaper version.

We used it with a German Shepherd, which is the more expensive version.

The Nordic is just as good as the Eureka, but it is much better quality, so if you want to make your own Eureka, you'll want to try it with the Nordic.

The Nordic is a little more expensive, but it is the best quality that we've had, and we like it.

The Nordic is made in the USA, so it has a good quality, but it is not the best quality as the Nordic is made in China.

The Nordic is very well made, and the quality of the Nordic is good, but the quality of the Nordic is very poor.

The Nordic is very poor quality, and the quality of the Nordic is poor, but the quality of the Nordic is excellent.

The Nordic is very thin, and it is very thin, but it is very thin, and it is very thin, and it is very thin, and it is very thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin, and it is thin"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,CG,"I've owned an original brownie pan and this one is the perfect pan for my needs.  It is so easy to clean and the pan is easy to clean.  The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is on the bottom.  I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit small.  I'll have to adjust the size if I need to use it more often.I bought this for my son's bedroom.  It is very nice and his room is very nice.  The black color is very vibrant.  I just wish the curtains were more vibrant.  I have used it a couple of times.  It is a very good quality product and looks great in my room.This is a great pillow for a few bucks.  It has a good grip, but it is not as good as a traditional pillow.  I don't recommend this pillow at all.  I have a few other pillow cases in my collection that I like and this is the one.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.I received this item on November 18th, 2013.  It was packaged well, and was packaged well.  It was well packaged.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money."

It is quiet and does the job perfectly. I wish it was a bit thicker. The only thing I would change is to order the red one. It's a bit too big for my needs and my grandson will probably be able to fit it on his bed. It's very easy to put it on the wall and I'm sure he will love it.This is a great design.  It has a nice deep blue color that doesn't fade or fade.  It is a great size and I like that it has a shelf.  It is very quiet.  I would recommend it.This is a good little tree.  I have a small tree in my bedroom and this tree stands out.  I have a tree in my yard and this tree stands out.  It is very attractive and the tree has a lot of branches.  It is easy to store and it is very easy to assemble.  I am very happy with the tree.This is the only one I have that isn't a magnet. It's a nice feature, but it's not enough to make it a magnet.

The magnet is solid and well-made. It holds the magnet securely, but it doesn't hold the magnet in place.

I also like that the magnet has a sharp handle, so I can bend it, so it doesn't slide around the bottom of the magnet."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use for hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds more, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is important to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal for one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star herefor the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room for spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into more parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.
Or do like me and have all 3!"
